<title>Quest of Dungeons turns 3 years old, a small message for the community | David Amador</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="Nintendo Switch, Quest of Dungeons">
<meta name="description" content="Exactly 3 years ago today, March 25th, Quest of Dungeons was released on Steam and iOS.

Feels unreal thinking what happened in these past three years, for those who remember I wasn’t even sure the game could make it to Steam, let alone end up being accepted by PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for their consoles.

A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.">

<p>A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this chance to say thank you to everyone who purchased the game, who helped by making Youtube videos, streaming, recommending to friends, and all the support. If I was able to convince anyone to accept the game on their console/platform it was because the players were talking about it, purchasing and saying they cared.

<p><img alt="Hugs" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gKx4R.gif"></p>
<p><strong>What now?</strong><br>
Many of you have been asking if I’m working on something new, and the answer is yes, but it’s still a bit soon to discuss what it is, I’ll share more details at a later time. But I’m excited (although a bit nervous) to start working on something new after 4 years of dev in the same project.</p>
<p><strong>What about QoD now?</strong><br>
Although I’m moving to new projects that doesn’t mean work on QoD is completely halting. I intend to keep fixing issues with new devices/OS, this is particularly true with mobile devices which rapidly evolve. I don’t have immediate plans for new content (another popular question), but again, might happen if something makes sense to add in order to improve the game.<br>
As of recently a common question is “Quest of Dungeons on Switch when?”, and while I would love to have the game there, especially with Wii U fading out, and because the game fits well on a portable mode, the ultimate decision to have the game there is up to Nintendo. All I can say about this is that I’ll talk with them and will inform you of any changes.</p>
<p>That’s it for now, thank you for reading. As always feel free reach me via twitter, email, etc. Until the next update.<br>
