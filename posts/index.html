  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>2025! This has been, for the lack of a better expression, a stressful year. I still remember around end of 2024 many people saying “things will change next year”. And change they did.
For me personally, professionally and overall worldwide events turned this year into a constant state of alert that made almost every week in sync with my weekly “Cloud it’s Wednesday” post.
Intraconnected-world 🕸️ Even if someone’s work doesn’t depend on using the internet, we can’t escape it these days. The problem for me really is that “The Internet” as I’ve grown to know it, is for the most part gone.

Was it a notification, scrolling a feed, did you saw my post and pressed the link, an RSS feed perhaps? What was the interruption that broke your flow, and do you remember the last thing before? Or even before, before you were on socials or scrolling whatever got you here?
Sorry, maybe an exaggeration here, it hasn’t been that long, but how often does that happen? That rabbit-hole where you set your time to do a certain thing and by the end you don’t even remember what it was?

    <p>Why? After several years working with Unity, both for personal and contract projects, I decided to finally properly test and use Godot.
I had been keeping an eye on it for a few years, but Unity’s controversial policy changes in late 2023 were the final push I needed to start experimenting seriously with an alternative engine, even if I could use my custom engine.
I guess the sort of exploding new wave of devs switching to Godot made me even more tempted, adoption is rapidly expanding.

    <p>Why? My 8-9 year old Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard died 🪦 (actually it’s been showing signs for a while), so I decided to search the market.
At first I just wanted “the same one”, but they are discontinued, even used ones are expensive, and many didn’t had the dongle anymore (btw don’t buy this KB without the bundled dongle, comes locked from factory, you can’t use a different one, shame on you MS). I found that some brands will eventually have similar models later this year (but no release date yet) but I needed to start changing now.

    <p>There’s a rise in the popularity of cozy games, the ones that are not about just hard challenges, combat or adrenaline, but about comfort and attempt of well-being. Those are great, and it’s incredible to see the indie scene doing many interesting things in that department.
But I always have this on the back on my mind as one of my favourite things, one thing I’m usually very interested in, cozy feelings/atmosphere that can be found in unexpected places.

    <p>🕛 2024 I initially intended to do a “end of year” post BEFORE the EOY talking about some stuff, but that never happened because work and other things kept getting in the way. 2024 was a weird year, from work, to personal, to world, to finances, to game dev, to everything really.
I just feel tired honestly, that’s the best way I can describe 2024!
Ok that started in a weird way, but allow me some latitude here… The world is in a weird state, economy, layoffs everywhere, the game dev industry in a very fragile state; and suddenly every company is betting all their chips on “AAAAeee IIIIII”, politics seem wacko, climate change, social networks going bananas, overall everyone trying to find their feet.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>👽 So, is it back? I like the Alien franchise a lot and tend to talk about it more than I probably should. But if I narrow it down, my focus is mostly on Alien and Aliens — two of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Then we had the weirdness of Alien³ and Alien Resurrection, which had some cool action but also a ton of questionable decisions. Prometheus started as something separate but eventually merged into the Alien universe; and while I think it has its merits (especially the visuals and large-scale sci-fi world-building), there are plenty of head-scratching and plain dumb moments. And Covenant? Oh I don’t even want to talk about that one, it exists.

    <p>🧵 origin thread In 2018 I started a thread on Twitter (later renamed X 🙄) where I shared some game development tricks devs used to get around bugs, software, hardware and/or time constraints. Later I kept adding more posts to that thread, and there’s some cool information there. But because I now went through the process of replicating that thread on both Mastodon and Bluesky; it got me thinking, I should probably put this on my own blog, a single post, which is easier to read, also in case those websites are ever gone. If I find more I’ll add them later. This page may take a bit to load due to images, gifs videos etc.

For the first time, players around the world could try it. I was quite anxious about this; it had been a few years in the making, mostly nights and weekends. I had little idea of what to expect, but being on Steam was simultaneously exciting and terrifying. What if people hated it?

📝 WordPress Since the very beginning (~2008) this blog has been powered by WordPress, it served me well, it worked, had a nice backend to make the posts, plugins and themes. After a couple years I moved from shared hosting to a VPS, I had other websites and services I needed running and all in same machine was better and cheaper. But WordPress needs a lot of things, PHP, MySQL, maintenance in all those moving parts.
