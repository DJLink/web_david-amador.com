<p>I‚Äôm kind of disappointed since the iPad version was been delayed until we can properly test in on a device. It hasn‚Äôt been released here yet and I can‚Äôt really afford one right now or import it, it was already too much investment with a new Mac and the iPod touch.<br>
The game is running nicely on the emulator, with full HD graphics, no double pixel, but some users are reporting crashes so it‚Äôs on hold.<br>
We decided that we won‚Äôt put anything on the market without properly testing it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also anxious on how people will receive Vizati on the iPhone although I think the few reactions we had have been positive. Touching brings the experience to a whole new level.</p>
<p>So what‚Äôs on my queued list right now?</p>
<p>Well, first of all I‚Äôm immediately resuming work on Windows Phone 7. I what almost everything in place so it‚Äôs a questions of changing some assets, placing sound and finishing save/load while Rita is making our new trailer for the iPhone release.<br>
After that probably the iPad (or whenever I get my hands on a device).<br>
Hopefully if we can pull off some financial stability our next game will jump to development. It‚Äôs a more ambitious project and I‚Äôm quite excited to work on something new but let‚Äôs see how things turn out.</p>
