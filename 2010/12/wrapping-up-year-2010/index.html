<p>I‚Äôm tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.<br>
Developing <a href="http://vizati.differentpixel.com">Vizati</a> turned out a much more complex task that I imagined, making everything from the ground up, from engine to the actual game for 5 different platforms took me around 3x more time that I expected.

<p>I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for me but I‚Äôm glad I took the chance to put something out there, gives me a sense of achievement and well, at least I tried, won‚Äôt carry this one to my grave üòõ</p>

<p>I just want to say a big <strong>Thank You</strong> to everyone who bought Vizati, (btw, <a href="http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-VIZ/vizati">GamersGate is having a 65% off right now till Jan 2nd 2011, around ‚Ç¨2.5</a>) everyone who sent us so many emails about it, feedback, comments, bugs etc.</p>
<p>On a personal side I want to thank <a href="http://www.rita-silva.com">Rita</a> for jumping the indie bandwagon with me thus making Different Pixel possible without my stick-man figures, her art is awesome. Vizati was highly praised on it‚Äôs artistic look and that‚Äôs all on her, so I can‚Äôt wait to show you guys more stuff.
