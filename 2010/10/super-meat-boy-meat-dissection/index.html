Anyway, back on track‚Ä¶\nThe game is a fast paced platform game with a block of meat which mission is to reach Bandage Girl (it‚Äôs Super Meat Boy ‚Äúprincess peach‚Äù) on every level, for that we must jump, jump, jump, avoid traps, jump, did I mention we has to jump?\nThe entire game is about precision and button timing, you fail you die, too slow? goodbye.\nThis will put you swearing at the TV like you never did, believe me, and not because the buttons feel dumb or the game didn‚Äôt respond but because you sucked and died. The controls are so well responsive that it feels like they grabbed Super Mario controls code and improved it.\nPlus the Xbox360 controller buttons colors are almost the same as the SNES controller, I felt like going back in time.\nA curious thing is, there‚Äôs a run button, the X and another for jump, the A button. Most of the time you will be running so the run button feels almost useless. Well the obvious thing is, on tight platforms you won‚Äôt be running, the other thing is this was the first time since those early hardcore platform games which I felt that pressing that button all the time helped me grasping the controller better, and jump seem more timed because you are using the same finger to press them both. Just try it, you‚Äôll see what I mean.\nGraphically the game is simple but pretty with small details that you‚Äôll probably miss the first time you play each level. My only complaint is that the cutscenes don‚Äôt feel like they belong in the game, because the lack of detail in scenarios and characters, luckily most will put a smile on your face so no harm done.\nThe game is packed with unlockable characters from other indie games like Beat Trip, Braid, Gish, you name it. For that you need to collect bandages all across the levels. The other things is that each level has a Light and Dark World, (Zelda Link to the Past memories for me) and you unlock the Dark World, which is even harder when you score an A in the Light World.\nSo the game is a blast and I highly recommend it, even more because right now is at 800 MS Points.\nHere‚Äôs a video of me playing, be warned I‚Äôm not a very good player üòõ\n","wordCount":"652","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2010-10-23T20:00:59Z","dateModified":"2010-10-23T20:00:59Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Amador"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/2010/10/super-meat-boy-meat-dissection/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"David Amador","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/ accesskey=h title="David Amador (Alt + H)"><img src=https://djlink.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>David Amador</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/games/ title=Games><span>Games</span></a></li><li><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/portfolio/ title=Portfolio><span>Portfolio</span></a></li><li><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/about/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://djlink.github.io/web_david-amador.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Super Meat Boy, meat dissection</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2010-10-23 20:00:59 +0000 UTC'>October 23, 2010</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;652 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;David Amador&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/2010-10-23-super-meat-boy-meat-dissection.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I don‚Äôt usually write reviews about games, maybe mostly because I don‚Äôt play as often as I used to.
