      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-interruption&#34;&gt;An interruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, how did you get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a notification, scrolling a feed, did you saw my post and pressed the link, an RSS feed perhaps? What was the interruption that broke your flow, and do you remember the last thing before? Or even before, before you were on socials or scrolling whatever got you here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Gandalf I don&amp;rsquo;t remember&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gandalf_I_have_no_recollection.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, maybe an exaggeration here, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been that long, but how often does that happen? That rabbit-hole where you set your time to do a certain thing and by the end you don&amp;rsquo;t even remember what it was?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Ok, how did you get here?</p>

<p>Sorry, maybe an exaggeration here, it hasn&rsquo;t been that long, but how often does that happen? That rabbit-hole where you set your time to do a certain thing and by the end you don&rsquo;t even remember what it was?</p>
<h3 id="the-best-time-was-yesterday-now-its-today">The best time was yesterday, now it&rsquo;s today</h3>
<p>The irony of this title is I&rsquo;ve had it on my mind for a couple months, but kept postponing for later. <em>Oh &hellip; the lack of time, too much work, something got in the way&hellip;</em> nah, let&rsquo;s be honest here, there&rsquo;s always something that I (we?) keep leaving for later and could be done rather quickly.</p>
<p>If only I had focused, giving it the proper and full attention for the required time it needs to get done, no side-quests. And I&rsquo;m not just talking about big tasks that take weeks or months, but smaller ones, quick ones, that I could finish, snowballing the piece of mind that comes from taking action and getting things done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rarely just lack of time, if I sum up the wasted time looking at useless stuff or context switching since April (been a while since my <a href="/2025/04/switching-unity-to-godot-my-experience-so-far/">last post</a>) I could have gotten this post done a long, long time ago. <em>queues Star Wars theme</em>, speaking of that, Andor is just great isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>See, our brains have this tendency of stretching and tethering to other subjects. Or maybe it&rsquo;s a <em>me</em> problem.</p>
<h3 id="stress-from-not-taking-action">Stress from not taking action</h3>
<p>Being overwhelmed by things to do, tasks we want to finish, tasks we SHOULD finish, side projects, freezing over selection of what to do next; is a natural occurrence as we want to do more, and have more on our plate, are handed over more tasks to do, or //TODO: that we kept on delaying.</p>
<p>It can be work, personal things, asking for something, replying to that email/text, a difficult conversation.</p>
<p>The more we pile the worst it gets because the possibilities are now so many. And the process of freezing while selecting the best use of our time, becomes the time sink itself.</p>
<p>Procrastination, leaving it for later, I&rsquo;ll do that in a bit, but first I guess &hellip; hold on  &hellip;. let me just &hellip;. watch check this notification first&hellip;</p>
<p><img alt="A few moments later" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/few_moments_later.jpg"></p>
<p>Wait where did the time go? It&rsquo;s that easy isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<h3 id="free-time-guilt">Free-time guilt</h3>
<p>Have a bit of time you could actually relax, rest and recharge your batteries but feel guilty you should be working?</p>
<p>In a way that might be because there isn&rsquo;t a clear separation of tasks time and &ldquo;me time&rdquo;, so if we context-switch a lot in allocated time for work, in the time you should be resting the brain doesn&rsquo;t feel like it accomplished what it should have. Limbo.</p>
<p>Do you start a movie and pick up the phone while the title is rolling?</p>
<h3 id="doom-scrolling">Doom scrolling</h3>
<p>An expression that gets thrown a lot to define how the internet is (attempting and succeeding) to trap us on an endless scrolling of brainrot content. The quality really doesn&rsquo;t matter, their whole goal is to keep us there, and that&rsquo;s also one of the reason why the internet overall feels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittified</a>.</p>
<p>And while that is a whole different topic, it does prey and augments the issue that our attention span is being reduced, harder to stay focused on something.</p>
<h3 id="donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>
<p>Wait, what? Yeah sorry, bear with me for a second. üçå</p>
<p>I got Donkey Kong Bananza at launch (July 17th), so around 2 months ago, it&rsquo;s great, been playing a lot of it, has that right mix of gameplay and dopamine hit.</p>
<p>I found myself ONLY playing that on Switch 2, whenever time allowed, for these 2 months, no switching (bad pun intended) to other games in between. There have been many games where I&rsquo;ll start and finish over time (still gotta complete Metroid Prime), but also a lot that I&rsquo;ll just eventually give up as time passes, not because I don&rsquo;t like them, but switching to other games usually makes it happen faster, because the attention span is now elsewhere, and then something else.</p>
<p>So DK Bananza made me have that strange and comfortable feeling that whenever I had time to play, I wouldn&rsquo;t idle-freeze considering &ldquo;what should I play now? &hellip;. omg I&rsquo;m out of time&rdquo;.
A bit like if you boot up Netflix and you&rsquo;re not sure exactly what to watch, you scroll a bit, time passes and &hellip; wait a notification &hellip; shit it&rsquo;s 2am.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="multiple-things-at-a-time">Multiple things at a time</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve always had that issue a bit, I remember back when I was working on Vizati or QoD (because it took years), many times that I decided to do a gamejam during on-going projects, my brain would get invested in that new thing and the old thing seemed like well &hellip; old now.</p>
<p>When you reach a more complicated part in #gamedev, or boring phases you might be a bit stuck, or unsure of the quality, everything else seems more exciting so it&rsquo;s easier to think &ldquo;what if I do a smaller project, this new idea seems better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Most times it isn&rsquo;t that, but our brain trying to get the next dopamine hit that comes from the initial stages of something, where the ideas just flow and our brain lits.</p>
<p>Learning can be quite interesting but we, as a population, are mostly consuming &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; 10 seconds at a time and moving on, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, this becomes a cycle.</p>
<p><img alt="Calvin and Hobbes short attention span" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calvin_hobbes_short_attention_span.jpg">

<h3 id="one-thing-at-a-time">One thing at a time</h3>
<p>I was having this conversation with a friend the other day about TV Shows, he watches multiple weekly-released TV Shows at a time, I wait for full seasons, so we are always out-of-sync if we want to discuss about a particular show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to watch just one show at a time, not necessarily binge watching in one weekend, but only one, until I finish the season or quit watching, very often I&rsquo;ll wait weeks (waiting for Alien TV show to wrap up) for something to complete. I can watch at my own speed, but only one. This is probably the only situation where I can control that very well, no pressure, I don&rsquo;t even think about it, I know it usually pays off, I can wait, know how much time I&rsquo;ll need to watch, when I fill that in, and with it comes a certain liberation of either finishing or quitting them.</p>
<p>So can I do this with other things? Well&hellip;. not quite, for example this article you are reading (still there?), it wasn&rsquo;t written in one go, not because it needs research, or it&rsquo;s a super complicated topic, or even that long to write; but because when I searched that image of Calvin and Hobbes you saw a bit above, I got side-tracked and ended up watching unrelated stuff and then decided it was already late and might as well do it &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img alt="Han Solo It&rsquo;s not my fault" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/han_solo_not_my_fault.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="social-networks">Social Networks</h3>
<p>Except it is!</p>
<p>Well sure the world seems crazy now (or I am?), and a big part of our lives is interacting online somehow, we are constantly bombarded by things to trigger us.</p>
<p>One can logoff and &ldquo;touch grass&rdquo;, that is actually surprisingly easier than I anticipated (I managed to not use Twitter for months now, and I thought it would be a problem), I don&rsquo;t miss it, although I do have that feeling that I might &ldquo;be missing something&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t deny that a lot of work opportunities came from that platform!</p>
<p>But that enshittification spreads quickly, recently I&rsquo;ve being going to LinkedIn more often; to search for work and/or maybe something a bit more stable (btw do tell me if you are looking, or know someone in need for a programmer with my &ldquo;particular set of skills&rdquo;); and that Feed is absolute trash fire, people are using it as they used Twitter and other networks, most stuff I see there almost always unrelated to work, but instead &ldquo;the drama&rdquo; of the day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s everywhere now, it used to be more contained to certain corners of the internet.</p>
<p>And the problem is that there is no winning there, not worth trying, fuelling arguments will just take your time, sanity, and kill your mood. I&rsquo;ve seen mutuals enrolling in discussions that I know are topics close to their hearts but it won&rsquo;t help at all unfortunately.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why those algorithms push certain posts to the front of the page, for &hellip;</p>
<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>By now I imagine a large percentage has stopped reading the article, maybe because it&rsquo;s not that interesting or any good, but some got a notification and &ldquo;quickly check&rdquo; and are not on another path, who knows where they are now, keeping someone engaged is hard on it&rsquo;s own, especially if there are millions of possible distractions.</p>
<p>Many freemium games have that gotcha thing, to keep you hooked, engaged, if you aren&rsquo;t paying with money, you are paying with time. Your life time!</p>
<p>An interesting argument I heard once &ldquo;David you can say that about anything, a book wants to keep you engaged, a movie as well&rdquo;.
And while we can agree, I disagree on the fundaments, because a company doesn&rsquo;t care much if you read the book as long as you pay for it, or buy the ticket, or the DVD. The intention of quality will come from the creator to make you satisfied enough to see/buy their next work, to recommend to friends. If they trick you once they probably won&rsquo;t do it again.</p>
<p>But with a shift to live-services, subscriptions and freemium models, things are specifically designed to keep us hooked all the time, they HAVE to trick us constantly, the money doesn&rsquo;t come directly from each purchase, not even from each user, but from carefully handcrafted/manipulated loop to exploit our time.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/almost-19-of-japanese-people-in-their-20s-have-spent-so-much-money-on-gacha-they-struggled-with-covering-living-expenses-survey-reveals/"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19_percent_japanese_people_gotcha_games.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this article crazy? This is the result over time, it&rsquo;s insane and quite upsetting.</p>
<p>Ok I went on a weird tangent there, let&rsquo;s talk about &hellip;.</p>
<h3 id="work--routine">Work &amp; routine</h3>
<p>Work is something that luckily I&rsquo;ve managed to keep in a more controlled state, and I don&rsquo;t find it as problematic, but it&rsquo;s a combination of multiple things that help with that, and two of the ones I consider most important for me is a clear set of decided things that need to be done and routine.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m not a good &ldquo;decider of things&rdquo;, but I can usually be better at getting them done, or finding a way, or just asking someone else for help. The goal is clear, I just have to get there. Even if there&rsquo;s a bug where I don&rsquo;t know anything, there&rsquo;s a clear goal &ldquo;fix this issue&rdquo;. The problem really comes from a blank canvas, or until I can decide the first stroke of paint and color I guess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why planning is so important, and some people are great at planning but not starting; I&rsquo;m better at starting if I don&rsquo;t have to plan much. None is necessarily better that the other, but knowing your strengths is good.</p>
<p>I few times I got asked &ldquo;why are you doing this?&rdquo;, and the answer is often &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but if I don&rsquo;t start I&rsquo;ll never know&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lack of planning might only take you so far, but lack of action takes you nowhere. So usually just starting is great, but focus, and that&rsquo;s usually the advice I give to anyone asking me &ldquo;How can I learn gamedev?&rdquo;. Just &hellip; start!</p>
<p>Routine is extremely important as well, I could not have accomplished working remotely for so many years if I didn&rsquo;t set a clear &ldquo;time to start working&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s always flexibility sure, but I quickly learned the best way is just habits and routine, your brain and body knows it&rsquo;s time and it&rsquo;s much easier.</p>
<p>Getting up, going for a walk, not random, mostly always the same path so that I don&rsquo;t get distracted but still get some exercise and it helps with stress, coming back sort yourself and just start working.</p>
<p>I guess the third factor that is important is &hellip;</p>
<h3 id="accountability">Accountability!</h3>
<p>A month or so ago I read two different things within a couple days apart that got me curious.
One person was saying that they were building a game and sharing the progress on social but the lack of engagement from sharing the progress was making them unsure and demotivated about the project and they haven&rsquo;t been able to progress much. That&rsquo;s rough, and very relatable.</p>
<p>A few days after I read on an unrelated forum someone talking about marketing and video-promotional-content not being great for people who don&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that. A few comments deep there was someone talking about streaming, and that streaming themselves working, even if most of the time for 0 viewers, had made them more productive because they had to plan something doing online.</p>
<p>Now that got my attention.</p>
<p>I talked with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sorcerystory">a friend</a> who&rsquo;s been streaming gamedev for a while and she confirmed that there are things that she plans, otherwise it would be harder to just &hellip; be here.</p>
<p>So I decided to give it a try, been doing it for a month now, and yeah it&rsquo;s pretty cool, I plan a few tasks, some take longer, others are shorter, but if I run out of planned things, I have to just come up with something on the fly (sometimes I&rsquo;ll see bugs while live so it helps). Most of the time I&rsquo;m at zero viewers, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter because it keeps you motivated to work on your own stuff, also you never know who might show up.</p>
<p>A great side effect is that I found myself talking while typing, like reading the code out loud and the process behind it, even if alone (again because you never know), and that helps a ton, I realize how dumb some solutions might be before hand, like when you rubber duck it with someone.</p>
<p>I am not using a face camera, it was actually Joana who mention that to me, that a lot of people don&rsquo;t use cameras, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter depending on the streamer&rsquo;s goal. So I just grabbed an old GoPro, it&rsquo;s showing a view to my Keyboard, I have a Mic and I just work, it&rsquo;s fun. I even added a task list on screen which I update as I go (this was a viewer suggestion).</p>
<p><img alt="Twitch layout" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/david_twitch_streaming_setup.jpg"></p>
<p>That thermal printer on the right corner was yet another side-project that I thought &ldquo;what if I hook up a python script to receive notifications of new followers and trigger a print by USB?&rdquo; as you can see, the getting distracted by other things still does happen, luckily this one was short, it&rsquo;s done and I got it out of my system.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h3>
<p>I think in the past humans were able to stay focused more time mostly because there were less things in front of us, with a more modern connected-world comes a new challenge of being able to filter our the noise from what we need, while still staying in it, connected and alert to knowledge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this all comes from technology, like it&rsquo;s the worst thing ever, but it uses our weakness against us. People will always be distracted and not fully focused for long, it&rsquo;s natural, but the problem now is we are getting distracted with things that add little to our lives. Better to have a bunch of failed projects than 300h of videos, because the failed projects you got them out of your system.</p>
<h3 id="its-been-a-minute">It&rsquo;s been a minute</h3>
<p>Thank you for reading all of this, some of it might not make sense, but this is usually the result of my brain dumping a bunch of thoughts in one post, something I wanted to talk about, the best part is that I&rsquo;ve cleared this from my mind, it feels good, even if no-one reads it, it was something I wanted to do and now it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>That thing you&rsquo;ve been meaning to do? Start, just do it, don&rsquo;t end this just to browse the next YouTube video, or Instagram. We overestimate how much we can get done in a week, but we underestimate how much we can get done in a year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll paraphrase something I&rsquo;ve once read on a book (which I now can&rsquo;t remember).</p>
<p>Giving meaning to life comes from having a purpose, and having a purpose comes from taking action.</p>

<p>See you in the next post!</p>

      <title>Switching to a new Keyboard, the Glove80</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2025/03/new-keyboard-glove80/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:20:55 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 8-9 year old Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard died ü™¶ (actually it&amp;rsquo;s been showing signs for a while), so I decided to search the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I just wanted &amp;ldquo;the same one&amp;rdquo;, but they are discontinued, even used ones are expensive, and many didn&amp;rsquo;t had the dongle anymore (btw don&amp;rsquo;t buy this KB without the bundled dongle, comes locked from factory, you can&amp;rsquo;t use a different one, shame on you MS).
I found that some brands will eventually have similar models later this year (but no release date yet) but I needed to start changing now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>My 8-9 year old Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard died ü™¶ (actually it&rsquo;s been showing signs for a while), so I decided to search the market.</p>
<p>At first I just wanted &ldquo;the same one&rdquo;, but they are discontinued, even used ones are expensive, and many didn&rsquo;t had the dongle anymore (btw don&rsquo;t buy this KB without the bundled dongle, comes locked from factory, you can&rsquo;t use a different one, shame on you MS).
I found that some brands will eventually have similar models later this year (but no release date yet) but I needed to start changing now.</p>
<p>A friend recommended me a Kinesis or the ErgoDox, but for a variety of reasons I ended up going with a Glove80 which I found during my searches. From reviews I read online I saw a few saying it was one of the most comfortable KBs for smaller hands/fingers so I decided to give it a go. It&rsquo;s an expensive one, but it&rsquo;s split, concave, ortholinear and it has the F1-F10 keys which I think are a nice to have separate.</p>
<p>I anticipate a big learning curve, and there&rsquo;s a possibility I might not even get used to it. I found a bunch of posts of people who gave up and returned them (any of the KBs I mentioned really), so I anticipate friction. I&rsquo;m going to write a log on how things will progress and eventually post it. Regardless of failure or success.</p>
<h3 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h3>
<p>After much debating I decided to order it on February 6th, received it on February 14th, so overall pretty fast shipping + delivery.</p>
<p>I got the Rev2 with Cherry Blossom switches; and contrary to Rev1, it seems it always comes with a carrying case now, and this is how it was packed.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 Rev 2 unboxing" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_rev2_unboxing.jpg"></p>
<p>The box is indeed sturdy, and as the welcome note claims, good enough to travel, although it&rsquo;s on the big side so I don&rsquo;t see it as something to be carried around everyday, but for a trip or working elsewhere for a couple days it&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>It also came with some spare keycaps on a cloth bag, some tools and rubbers for tenting, and a USB-C (KB side) to USB-A (PC side) cable.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 extras in the case" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_unboxing_extras.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>You can setup the keyboard by bluetooth (no dongle) or via USB cable. You only need to connect the left part, and the right side always communicates with the left one wirelessly. However, to charge you need to connect a cable on both, not at the same time but if you want to never care about battery you&rsquo;ll need a USB split cable or 2 of them always plugged in. The left side runs out of battery faster than the right one so that&rsquo;s probably not an issue.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 tenting" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_tenting.jpg"></p>
<p>In terms of tenting there&rsquo;s several feet with some screws you can lower and put higher as needed, but I&rsquo;ve been using it flat. As I mentioned they ship it with some extra rubbers, for stability if needed to raise a lot, I have it on a deskmat and it&rsquo;s super stable, I guess on a desk directly, if you run into issues that could be useful.</p>
<p>Note for Mac users, the best way to just use it out of the box and having all keys work as they are on each key Label is U.S. International - PC as the keyboard layout.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 mac keyboard setting" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_mac_keyboard_setting.png"></p>
<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed it how low profile it is, I love it, so close to the desk, here&rsquo;s the left side near a Nintendo Switch (left).</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 low profile" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_side_profile_vs_nintendo_switch.jpg"></p>
<p>Ok just to be honest here, I just tried it but right now but I&rsquo;m still typing this on my temporary keyboard, I tried the Glove80 a bit and I&rsquo;m now on that &ldquo;OMG I regret this already!&rdquo; stage. The packing is very nice, the keyboard looks great and seems comfortable, but I&rsquo;m switching from ISO to ANSI, algo to split and ortholinear, everything is in a completely different place, I can barely find anything. Out of curiosity I did a <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">https://monkeytype.com/</a>  test and yeah this will take some getting use to, but I&rsquo;m excited for this.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 day one test typing" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_day_one_test_typing.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m typing this on the Glove80 now so it might take forever. I&rsquo;ve been practicing a little bit more and I started to average 20 words per minute (with a lot of errors and corrections). So it&rsquo;s still terrible but not as bad as yesterday, that&rsquo;s what I got to focus on.</p>
<p>Some observations already, most of my tests are still just words as I noticed that I need to get used to the ortholinear layout, I have a lot of fails that come from the muscle memory of fingers moving around, which is not as needed here. Also I&rsquo;m messing up all the time the usual shortcuts, CTRL, SHIFT, ALT, they are all now in different places so there&rsquo;s a lot to get used to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like much that the &ldquo;WIN&rdquo; key is on the right thumb cluster, so I&rsquo;m taking a note to maybe switch it with the layer key which I guess I&rsquo;ll use way less.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 left and right thumbcluster" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_change_thumbcluster.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m only using the keyboard at night but I&rsquo;ve been making progress, do a couple rounds of tests after work, I&rsquo;m more comfortable typing with it, doesn&rsquo;t feel as strange anymore, at least words.</p>
<p>The keyboard is indeed comfortable, not having to move my hands so much, really starting to grow on me. During the day I&rsquo;m using a regular KB and I can feel the wrists pressure. If I fully turn into this keyboard I can see myself not wanting to go back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that I now know exactly which characters I have more trouble typing, it&rsquo;s especially right hand pinky row (OPL) and left hand CDFV &ldquo;square&rdquo;. But mentally that has helped as I pause a bit, remember myself and do a bit less errors even if I&rsquo;m slower. I&rsquo;ve been trying to force myself not to look to the keyboard but once in a while I&rsquo;ll do a couple tests looking to get my bearings.</p>
<h3 id="day-5">Day 5</h3>
<p>Today I&rsquo;ve reached a 50 WPM speed test with 100%, that was an outliner but I&rsquo;m happy about it.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 5th day speed test" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_type_speed_day_5.png"></p>
<h3 id="day-7">Day 7</h3>
<p>Slowly but steady I&rsquo;m getting better. I found out that I tend to have the right side with a worse angle then the left side, probably bad posture from older keyboards, I guess I probably had the 1-piece keyboard always slightly more to the left, due to the mouse, so I tend to have my left wrist not as relaxed. This might be because of mouse use as well.</p>
<p>Yikes coding just kills your body slowly.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 5th day speed test" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_type_speed_day_7.png"></p>
<h3 id="day-8">Day 8</h3>
<p>The start of a new week, I decided I&rsquo;ll now introduce numbers and special keys like ( ) ; , . etc to my typing practice, it&rsquo;s time to start dealing with that.</p>
<h3 id="day-17">Day 17</h3>
<p>Most of the biggest &ldquo;speed&rdquo; progress was made in the first 2 weeks, now it&rsquo;s mostly being a bit more confident with the fingers, not as many mistakes, not necessarily being faster.
I found out that I can have shortcuts to use the keyboard as a mouse, like having 4 keys to move mouse UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, this is a godsend, sometimes I just want to move the mouse a little bit and switch back to keyboard, this speeds up things by a lot. I mapped it to holding LAYER key and IJKL for movement.</p>
<h3 id="day-18-to-29">Day 18 to 29</h3>
<p>Slow but steady&hellip;</p>
<p><img alt="progress" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_typing_progress.jpg"></p>
<p>I keep bouncing between using the Glove80 and going back to my keyboard depending on what I need, if I need faster coding sessions or if something that I&rsquo;m more comfortable with going slower.</p>
<h3 id="day-30">Day 30</h3>
<p>I just realized I&rsquo;ve been using it as my main keyboard for the past week or so of work, I&rsquo;m still not as fast, and many of the shortcuts still ilude me a bit, but for the most part I can work ok, it&rsquo;s rare that I have to speed type this past week, so it was the perfect time. Most work has been evaluation, debug and searching/fixing stuff, so I think I&rsquo;ll get there as fast as my old KB eventually.</p>
<p>This change was mostly due to a friend asking me last week how the change was going (he has a Kinesis so was curious), and I said I was feeling bad on doing the full change while I was not as good, due to contract work. And his comment about my speed probably already being good enough and that I should switch made me do it. Thing is, that final stretch can&rsquo;t be done in small bursts.</p>
<h3 id="mapping-tool">Mapping tool</h3>
<p>Glove80 provides a web interface where we can remap every key and layer. It&rsquo;s very intuitive, and how I remapped some of the keys in a layer for using mouse. Once you wrap it up, it exports a file, you just plug in the keyboard left part via USB mode, just drag a file to a storage disk that shows up on the computer, once it&rsquo;s there it ejects automatically, then repeat it for the right side. It&rsquo;s fast and just works. I haven&rsquo;t used this much but I can see myself in the long run wanting to do tweaks as I even talked a bit before.</p>
<p>Most of the keyboard keys are in a good position, even if it feels odd at first, but you can remap everything.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that once in a while when I&rsquo;m in a rush I still go back to a regular keyboard, I&rsquo;ve made good progress and I can see the advantages but I have nearly 2 decades of muscle memory on regular keyboards, so it will take some extra time to never have the feeling of requiring to switch back when I need to code faster or in a rush. Shortcuts especially are harder.
But if I keep this up I&rsquo;ll eventually only need it rarely or not at all.</p>
<p>The good things is that when I use it my posture is better.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 on a desk" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_photo_desk_showing_halve_distanced_desk.jpg"></p>
<p>I can have my shoulder blades in a more comfortable position, I feel myself less hunched and curled, my shoulders and wrists appreciate it. It&rsquo;s definitely worth learning how to use one and the cost. Again, coding slowly kills your body, have to try and delay it as much as possible.</p>
<p>A special note for the support on Discord, before the purchase and after, whenever I had a question there was always someone there to help (staff and community).</p>
<p>In terms of comfort this is one, if not the best keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever typed on, your hands just rest there, very small travel distance for the fingers even for me with small hands.
However, and because of that, it&rsquo;s nearly perfect but the outer edges columns are a bit too far for me so I need to move my hand a bit for those. But considering on my older keyboards I had to move it mostly ALL the time, this is a big plus.</p>
<p>On a bad note, which is not necessarily the keyboard problem, but because it&rsquo;s not Bluetooth with a dongle, I found out Windows Bluetooth is so unreliable I had to force my device not to allow power management. Luckily that fixed disconnections with the Glove80 right away. It&rsquo;s possible I would have issues with other stuff (usually I have with Bluetooth headphones issues once in a while), but a keyboard failing wasn&rsquo;t something that I could have happening. While having a dongle seems cumbersome I feel like with all the connection/firmware is on the manufacturer side it&rsquo;s more reliable.</p>
<p>If you plan on using the RGB (I don&rsquo;t), prepare for the battery to die fast, just use it wired. And while I love the design, the rectangular edges seem a bit &ldquo;rough&rdquo;, I mean it&rsquo;s nitpicking but it&rsquo;s also not a cheap keyboard.</p>
<p><img alt="Glove80 Rev 2 unboxing" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glove80_cherry_blossom.jpg"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on the fence on the best place to keep my trackball mouse. Because the keyboard can be much farther apart, if you put the mouse on the right side, it becomes too uncomfortable, which defeats the purpose.
So sometime if I need to use it for longer sessions (like painting software etc) I just put the right part of the keyboard to the middle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t regret buying this, even if it was the most expensive keyboard I ever got.</p>
<p><img alt="Most expensive keyboard so far" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/the_most_expensive_kb_so_far.jpg"></p>
<p>I would recommend this keyboard as a good one, for sure. However, having never tried any of the other popular ones (Kinesis, Ergodox, etc), I can&rsquo;t know for sure if this one is better or worse, all I can say is that I&rsquo;m happy with it so far.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any particular questions, be glad to answer, I know this isn&rsquo;t exactly a &ldquo;good review post&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s just a dump of my process to get here.</p>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;-so-is-it-back&#34;&gt;üëΩ So, is it back?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise a lot and tend to talk about it more than I probably should. But if I narrow it down, my focus is mostly on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî two of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Then we had the weirdness of &lt;em&gt;Alien¬≥&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/em&gt;, which had some cool action but also a ton of questionable decisions. &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt; started as something separate but eventually merged into the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; universe; and while I think it has its merits (especially the visuals and large-scale sci-fi world-building), there are plenty of head-scratching and plain dumb moments. And &lt;em&gt;Covenant&lt;/em&gt;? Oh I don‚Äôt even want to talk about that one, it exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="-so-is-it-back">üëΩ So, is it back?</h1>
<p>I like the <em>Alien</em> franchise a lot and tend to talk about it more than I probably should. But if I narrow it down, my focus is mostly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)"><em>Alien</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)"><em>Aliens</em></a> ‚Äî two of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Then we had the weirdness of <em>Alien¬≥</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em>, which had some cool action but also a ton of questionable decisions. <em>Prometheus</em> started as something separate but eventually merged into the <em>Alien</em> universe; and while I think it has its merits (especially the visuals and large-scale sci-fi world-building), there are plenty of head-scratching and plain dumb moments. And <em>Covenant</em>? Oh I don‚Äôt even want to talk about that one, it exists.</p>
<p>It all felt like the franchise had lost its way. Then came the announcement of a new <em>Alien</em> movie‚Äîthis time from a different director, Fede Alvarez, and under the Disney umbrella. I tend to get overly hyped only to be crushed later, so I skipped the theater release and only watch it, in digital release, this past weekend. Twice.</p>
<p>And yes, it‚Äôs back. I really enjoyed it. While it has flaws, it gets so much right that I can honestly say I‚Äôll rewatch it later alongside <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em>‚Äîthe only two movies in the franchise I rewatch regularly. So, if you want my TL;DR opinion: <em>Go watch it. It‚Äôs good.</em> But I have a lot I want to talk about. Instead of spoiling things on social media, I‚Äôll just dump my thoughts here.</p>

<h1 id="-the-mood">üé• The Mood</h1>
<p><em>Alien Romulus</em> takes place in 2142, twenty years after the events of <em>Alien</em> ‚Äî roughly 37 years before Ripley is rescued in <em>Aliens</em>. In the intro, Weyland-Yutani recovers a cocoon from the wreckage of the Nostromo. That setup, paired with the futuristic-but-retro-looking tech, immediately set the tone. The lighting, sound, and atmosphere hit all the right notes. It was clear the filmmakers understood which vibes to channel from the original films and how to execute them.</p>

<h1 id="-the-plot-and-crew">üé• The Plot and Crew</h1>
<p>As I mentioned, the movie is set 20 years after <em>Alien</em>. It begins on Jackson‚Äôs Star Colony, where Rain lives with her synthetic brother, Andy. Early on, we learn Rain‚Äôs parents died working in the mines, and Andy was programmed to help and protect her.</p>
<p><img alt="Work quota" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_work_quota_1.jpg"></p>
<p>They work for Weyland-Yutani, and Rain has met her 12000 hours contract, but the corporation arbitrarily extends Rain&rsquo;s contract by doubling the hours, forcing them to stay on Jackson for several more years.</p>
<p><img alt="Work quota" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_work_quota_2.jpg"></p>
<p>A group of friends, who had the same thing happening to them, convinces Rain to join their team. The group includes Tyler, his sister Kay, their cousin Bjorn, and Navarro.</p>
<p><img alt="Alien Romulus Crew" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_crew.jpg"></p>
<p>Their plan? Flee the planet to Yvaga, by traveling to a derelict station in orbit to steal sleeping pods for the nine-year cryosleep journey to the distant, and Weyland-Yutani free planet.</p>

      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The derelict station is of course the place where they took the xenomorph cocoon they found on the Nostromo in the introduction sequence, where - <em>spoilers</em> - all hell broke loose.</p>
<p><img alt="Door unlock" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_mother.jpg"></p>
<p>The main reason they went to Rain is Andy, since he&rsquo;s a Weyland-Yutani android, he has credentials to speak MOTHER, the Operative System MU/TU/UR, unlock the spaceship and give them access to what they need.</p>
<p>Soon they find the pods they were looking for, but they lack the necessary power, only having energy for three years, which is not enough.</p>
<p><img alt="Pods" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_pods.jpg"></p>
<p>So they search deeper into the station, and find a room which is locked, and inside, a room full of facehuggers, frozen, hibernating, powered by the batteries, so when they remove them, a lockdown starts to prevent the spread, and the facehuggers start to wake up.</p>
<p><img alt="frozen facehuggers" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_frozen_facehuggers.jpg"></p>
<p>This scene has 3 very important things in my opinion, first of all they accidentally release all the facehuggers; second we see Bjorn fending off facehuggers a couple times with success, saving Tyler in the process, which shows he&rsquo;s a fighter, a survivor and willing to help.</p>
<p><img alt="Bjorn facehugger" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_bjorn_facehuggers_2.jpg"></p>
<p>But also, once they find themselves locked into that room, they have to put a new chip on Andy hoping the credentials get updated and allows to unlock the room.</p>
<p><img alt="Chip" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_chip.jpg"></p>
<p>They successfully do that, but in the process his prime directive of protecting Rain gets replaced with protecting Weyland-Yutani interests first. This makes Andy less sympathetic towards what the crew needs, only helping if it suits the company, even if there&rsquo;s still many traits of his former self there, probably the most well written character in this movie.</p>
<p>When they finally leave the room there&rsquo;s an incredible facehugger hallway chase scene.</p>
<p><img alt="Hallway chase" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_hallway_facehuggers.gif"></p>
<p>Sadly Navarro is the first victim via facehugger, they power up Rook, a semi destroyed Android that looks like Ash from the first movie in order to get more information.</p>
<p><img alt="Rook" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_wake_up_rook.jpg"></p>
<p>In this process it&rsquo;s clear that Navarro is probably done for, so when Andy tries to prevent Navarro from returning to the ship, Bjorn flees with her, stealing the ship, splitting the team in two.</p>
<p>But Navarro time is ending, so we get one of the coolest chestburster scenes in the franchise, with an X-ray.</p>
<p><img alt="Navarro" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_xray_chestburster.gif"></p>
<p>And this causes the ship to crash on an hangar on the other side of the station.</p>

<p>Bjorn later dies trying to kill the xenomorph that hatched from Navarro, while still in it&rsquo;s coccoon, leaving Kay alone. She tries and escape the hangar, but is trapped with the now full grown xenomorph.</p>
<p><img alt="Hallway chase" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_kay_door.jpg"></p>
<p>Andy proves he&rsquo;s not joking around anymore by refusing opening a door to her.</p>
<p><img alt="Door unlock" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_andy_finger_door.jpg"></p>
<p>By arguing that would also allow the xenomorph to pass we get a terrifying scene because the Xenomorph really seems to be taking it&rsquo;s time hoping the door would open, adding more to the tension, but eventually grabbing Kay regardless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going through the whole movie, there&rsquo;s a few more parts of the later sections I&rsquo;ll discuss below on each character, these were just a few of the things that I wanted to just talk about, and just got a bit carried away, the final act section is a bit weaker, the whole baby-hybrid thing, but still better than most stuff we&rsquo;ve got in recent years.</p>
<p>The Xenomorph is well done and scary, the practical effects help.</p>
<p><img alt="Xenomorph" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_xenomorph.jpg"></p>
<p>The facehuggers are the &ldquo;main enemy&rdquo; for half of the movie, and it works, they have one scene with Andy, Rain and Tyler that reminded me of The Walking Dead, they had to move slowly not to be detected!</p>
<p><img alt="facehuggers temperature room" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_facehugger_hallway.jpg"></p>
<p>Eventually we learn that the derelict station was attempting to synthesize the &ldquo;black goo&rdquo; to create strong humans.</p>
<p><img alt="black goo" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_black_goo.jpg"></p>
<p>Which is a theme Prometheus/Covenant was exploring, Rook even referring to the black goo as &ldquo;Prometheus fire&rdquo; , this is the main mission Rook has and it passes down to Andy, to save a sample and bring it to Weiland.</p>
<p><img alt="Rook and Andy" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rook_andy.jpg"></p>
<p>Now I just want to talk a bit about each character before wrapping up.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="andy--n-d-255">Andy / N-D-255</h3>
<p><img alt="Andy" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_andy_1.jpg"></p>
<p>First of all I want to talk about Andy, played by David Jonsson, he steals this movie with his performance, not only the character is well written, convincing, and makes sense within this world, the acting is just excellent.
The duality of good and evil in the Android has been explored before, Prometheus and Covenant especially trying doing &ldquo;something&rdquo; with the Android David, but honestly I think if failed.</p>
<p>And this is where Andy shines in my opinion.</p>
<p>At the beginning we learn that Andy has been reprogrammed to help Rain, it&rsquo;s prime directive to do anything to protect her. We also see that this model glitches often, which I wonder if a callback to Bishop in Aliens mentioning older models were often &ldquo;twitchy&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img alt="Bishop" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_bishop_callback.jpg"></p>
<p>But later on, in order to open a door they install a new program on Andy, and it&rsquo;s just amazing to see the transformation, his prime directive is now to serve the company, but it&rsquo;s done in such a good way, and they never went for the clich√© &ldquo;it&rsquo;s now a full evil robot and wants to kill them&rdquo; angle.</p>
<p>Instead we see it in subtle things, Andy is more confident, always on track to protect the company mission, and still remembers everything, and learned the small things that were done to him, like a comment to Rain about being left behind. This shows more humanity from the character even though being an Android, he doesn&rsquo;t feel some things were right, but also doesn&rsquo;t bother him.</p>
<p>The one thing that didn&rsquo;t quite clicked for me was one line towards the end when Andy kills a xenomorph while protecting Rain and says &ldquo;Get away from her&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;You bitch&rdquo;. This is a direct reference to Ripley in Aliens, but the &ldquo;You bitch&rdquo; felt out of place, and out of character, until I rewatched the movie; and noticed that in the beginning of the movie Bjorn says to Andy &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done, bitch.&rdquo; So it made more sense to me now, Andy heard it, stayed passive, and unleashed it at a later time, suiting the whole scene better and even making it a better tiny arc overall. I probably missed tons of things during my first viewing.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going into this movie looking forward to the Android, but this was one of the best parts of the movie. If we get a sequel I hope they explore it a bit more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="human-crew">Human crew</h2>
<p>When it comes to the human crew they worked well, definitely the smartest crew in last few Alien movies (looking at you Prometheus and Covenant).</p>
<h3 id="rain">Rain</h3>
<p><img alt="Rain" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rain_0.jpg"></p>
<p>Rain is &ldquo;the Ellen Ripley&rdquo; of this movie, that&rsquo;s what people will probably be comparing her to, which might sound a bit unfair; but the movie dangerously, yet successfully, do a lot of inspired angles/scenes with her so it&rsquo;s bound to happen.</p>
<p><img alt="Rain" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rain_1.jpg"></p>
<p>Luckily it works, her motivation is simple yet effective, escape Weiland and go to Yvaga, her protective nature comes into play with both Andy and later Kay.</p>
<p><img alt="Rain" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rain_4.jpg"></p>
<p>It never felt forced in my opinion and kept the character plot moving forward and making her more decisive as the movie developed.</p>
<p><img alt="Rain" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rain_5.jpg"></p>
<p>She literally goes face to face with xenomorphs, a callback to Alien¬≥ famous shot.</p>
<p><img alt="Rain" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rain_2.jpg"></p>
<p>The idea of making a shooting scene in zero gravity where the acid is floating all around is so good, combined with the elevator shaft part, it was a great action sequence, they could have ended the movie there.</p>
<p><img alt="Rain" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_rain_3.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="bjorn">Bjorn</h3>
<p><img alt="Bjorn" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_bjorn_1.jpg"></p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a bit of Hudson, and starts out only as a jerk towards Andy. But he did a good job, fends off several facehugers, saves Tyler, does what he thinks is in the best interest to save Navarro, because he doesn&rsquo;t trust androids, so he thinks Andy wants to kill her. He later tries to kill a xenomorph in a cocoon but dies in the process.</p>
<p><img alt="Bjorn facehugger" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_bjorn_facehuggers_1.jpg"></p>
<p>He had a big mouth but would not back off in face of danger, so I was a bit sad he didn&rsquo;t lasted longer.</p>

<h3 id="tyler">Tyler</h3>
<p><img alt="Tyler" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/alien-romulus/alien_romulus_tyler_1.jpg"></p>
<p>I guess I can say is the Hicks on this movie, from the more protective characteristics to teaching Rain how to use the guns, mostly callbacks to Aliens, but for me that was fine, I don&rsquo;t think his character stand out much, even if he had a lot of screen time; but once they found the pods he was mostly in a supportive role, but he didn&rsquo;t felt out of place or anything like that. Sometimes that&rsquo;s required for the other characters to move along.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s the ship pilot, I immediately got Vasques vibes, and sadly she dies way too soon, but on the other hand, we got thet classic facehugger and chestburster scenes, but even better, with an the X-ray, and who ever thought of that is a G-E-N-I-US. A chestburster scene made even more terrifying than it already is, on a confined space, on a moving spaceship. Worth it.</p>

<p>Kay is revealed to be pregnant, and unfortunately ends up the victim of a very graphic birth scene, giving birth to a hybrid baby a bit like Prometheus but still somewhat different, I guess giving more information on the whole goo-engineers-xenomorphs thing.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before there is a really great scene in the ship hangar where she gets locked in a room with a xenomorph, it lands on some stairs above her, to a scary and chilling effect, and later the horror of being locked with the xenomorph because of Andy&rsquo;s refusal to open the door.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another Android in the movie which is the same model as Ash in original Alien, sadly Ian Holm passed away in 2020, so even if they would had to CGI de-age him, this meant it wasn&rsquo;t even the original actor. The CGI isn&rsquo;t great in some scenes, but we could&rsquo;t just have him constantly in dark environments to mask of stuff since he does show up quite a few times until the end. We only see it in a destroyed state from the waist up (another callback), I don&rsquo;t think it would have mattered much, we know it&rsquo;s an Android, it didn&rsquo;t had to look real, but CGI was a bit of uncanny valley. But for the role itself it was Ash again, doing everything for the company, twisting words and manipulation to get what he wants. The movie would have worked without the resemblance, but this way it does a nice connection and the movie feels even more that it actually belongs.</p>

<h1 id="-conclusion">üé• Conclusion</h1>
<p>Still here? Thanks for sticking with me through this brain dump! Writing this post helped me get all my thoughts out, and I even managed to give my blog a bit more attention (which I keep saying I‚Äôll do but rarely follow through).</p>
<p>Watching the movie a second time helped me appreciate it more. Scenes that initially felt a bit disjointed made more sense. Honestly, I think this movie needs a Director‚Äôs Cut. From what Ridley Scott mentioned in interviews, Fede Alvarez had to cut a lot of material by Scott&rsquo;s suggestion to make the movie shorter and to the point quicker. The upcoming Blu-ray release includes an &ldquo;X-Ray Edition,&rdquo; so maybe that‚Äôs an extended cut. I‚Äôll definitely be doing a third viewing if that‚Äôs the case.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm now looking forward to the next movie (whatever it ends up being) and the <em>Alien: Earth</em> TV show coming out next year. The title already hints at being set on Earth, and I wonder if it ties into the ending of <em>Alien Resurrection</em>‚Äôs Special Edition, where they land on Earth. Time will tell.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="-before-i-go">‚åöÔ∏è Before I go</h1>
<p>Before I go, I just want to share some screengrabs of watches, cool looking watches have always been a thing in <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em>, and I was really happy to see that whenever possible the director would make sure they could be seen :)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I shutdown the VPS that has been hosting all my websites for the last ~10 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved everything to static content, including this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shutting-down-server.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;-wordpress&#34;&gt;üìù WordPress&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the very beginning (~2008) this blog has been powered by WordPress, it served me well, it worked, had a nice backend to make the posts, plugins and themes. After a couple years I moved from shared hosting to a VPS, I had other websites and services I needed running and all in same machine was better and cheaper. But WordPress needs a lot of things, PHP, MySQL, maintenance in all those moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shutting-down-server.gif"></p>
<h1 id="-wordpress">üìù WordPress</h1>
<p>Since the very beginning (~2008) this blog has been powered by WordPress, it served me well, it worked, had a nice backend to make the posts, plugins and themes. After a couple years I moved from shared hosting to a VPS, I had other websites and services I needed running and all in same machine was better and cheaper. But WordPress needs a lot of things, PHP, MySQL, maintenance in all those moving parts.</p>
<p>So for the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve been thinking in migrating it to something like Jekyll or Hugo, to serve it as static content. But the few times I looked into the process it seemed like a big task especially because I have 184 posts, I wasn&rsquo;t just starting from 0, I wanted to maintain the existing content, posts, images, URLs etc. So, a couple days ago I decided it was time.</p>
<h1 id="-converting-and-moving-the-websites">üìù Converting and Moving the websites</h1>
<h3 id="-questofdungeonscom">üîó questofdungeons.com</h3>
<p>This was the easier of them, it&rsquo;s just not working 100% as it was before (more on that in a bit). Site was just a couple of hand-made pages I hacked in HTML/CSS/JS years ago, so that was already done.</p>
<p>The only problem was the <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com/stats.html">stats page</a>  relied on a PHP script to pull the stats from Steam. PHP was out of the question since I wanted to host on GitHub, so I tried the full JavaScript approach, but that hits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> issue, and I would need a proxy for that, so for now I grabbed the last stats and it&rsquo;s serving it statically. I have to think of something else later since I don&rsquo;t have PHP anymore etc. But it&rsquo;s not important and the numbers aren&rsquo;t moving as much as they used to. I grabbed all files, pushed to a GitHub repo, activated pages, changed the nameservers, queued SSL cert, and voil√°, the site is now live.</p>
<h3 id="-upfallstudioscom">üîó upfallStudios.com</h3>
<p>The <a href="/2022/11/merged-personal-and-studio-blogs-into-one/">merging the Upfall Studios blog</a> a while ago was not an isolated act, I was thinking about this already. After the merge, <a href="https://www.upfallstudios.com">www.upfallstudios.com</a> was left with only the front page, which was static content already. I also had a doPresskit() <a href="https://www.upfallstudios.com/press/">page</a>, which was all PHP, and I need to keep it for games info etc. After a bit of search I found there is an <a href="https://github.com/Dvergar/dopresskit-static">alternative</a>, serving static content, so I converted and updated the site to use it, that way 100% of the site was ready. Easy and working as before.</p>
<h3 id="-david-amadorcom">üîó david-amador.com</h3>
<p>And now I was free to focus on the one I knew would be a headache, this blog. Full wordpress site, no static content, everything dynamic using plugins, MySQL, PHP and custom .htaccess rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ùå Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>From prior research, I was inclined to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> since all I read online was that it was good, also it&rsquo;s been around for 15 years, so it has proved it works and should be stable.
But after a couple days of messing around with configs and pre-requisites, packages versions mismatches between Jekyll, ruby, wordpress exporters etc, I gave up. Booting up a new site can be achieved fast, but I needed to also be able to import all of my content, and that proved to be hard. Also I started thinking about the future of the blog, what if in a couple years the version breaks on modern OS version, and I can&rsquo;t run the latest one due to some incompatibility, even on a VM that would be a nightmare to keep around just for one site.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚úÖ Hugo</li>
</ul>
<p>So I decided to go for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, single executable, it works, it&rsquo;s fast. Highly recommend it. The documentation does lacks sometimes, but between the forums, and looking at other people&rsquo;s pages on GitHub it&rsquo;s perfectly doable.</p>
<p>I had to export the data, and there are a couple of Wordpress plugins for that, the problem was that my server was old, i386, outdated Ubuntu version, the PHP server version had no Zip support, which most of those plugins needed. After messing around a bit with the server trying to install the proper dependencies, which included actually breaking the entire thing and having to restore from backup, I decided a different approached. Created a Docker VM with wordpress, imported my existing WP files and database locally, installed the required plugins and was finally able to export all.</p>
<p>üìÑ Now that I had all the files in markdown format, it was really more of a going through Hugo documentation, placing all freshly made files in place and cleaning up stuff. One neat thing is that you can run and edit an Hugo website live.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Hugo.exe server -D
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will make the site run on localhost:1313/ , so while you edit the markdown files, it will keep refreshing, I didn&rsquo;t even had to press F5, I could have it side by side and Ctrl+S, super fast to iterate.</p>
<p>üé• There was a LOT of YouTube embed code, that I placed over the years, and was not ever working anymore on original website, some of it had Macromedia code, yeah, that old! So I tried to fix all that, then just regex replace some stuff like wrong image paths.</p>
<p>üßë‚Äçüíª I also had to fix some of the programming code block notation. I was using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">pre</span> <span class="na">lang</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;LANG&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>for code blocks, but the parser collapsed in a couple posts, leaving pre tags, which was helpful in searching for them actually. I fixed all I could find.</p>
<p>üó£Ô∏è As for the comments, I had Disqus installed on Upfall Studios blog, but on this blog it was on WP system, so what I did was just import all the comments on Disqus and merged both. So the comment system should work on the bottom of all posts (say Hi if you want :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if all the comments are there though, one particular post I had to go back and import it manually again, but it also had over 100 comments, so it might have failed the first time. I still have all the old data, so if needed (and I can spot it) I can always import it again on Disqus.</p>
<p>üì∞ The RSS feed should theoretically still work for everyone who had from the old blog, but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure, once I put this post live I guess I&rsquo;ll know.</p>
<p>üíª So my current workflow is: I have a git repo with all the markdown and website code and I have the live website as a submodule, so whenever I made a change, I export it with Hugo, git commit all changes and GitHub pages just deploys them, feels like magic :D</p>
<h3 id="-speed">üöÄ Speed</h3>
<p>Oh its much faster, obviously, but look at the changes of before (left) and after (right) using PageSpeed Insights.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/david_amador_site_wordpress_vs_hugo_speed.png"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Still there? Well so far I&rsquo;m happy with the move, I do miss the nice WordPress backend thing if I&rsquo;m being honest, but I can live without it. I feel like in the long run I won&rsquo;t miss having to maintain that server, also the costs. Right now I&rsquo;m editing this on Obsidian, about to commit and see if it goes live, RSS and all. If you find any broken stuff or have suggestions let me know, either mastodon, email or a comment here.</p>
<p>Until the next time, where hopefully I&rsquo;ll talk about games! Thanks for reading.</p>

      <title>Unity enshittification round 2, moving on to custom tech.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After mostly a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2023/09/the-unity-enshittification-proprietary-tech-dangers-and-mostly-not-talking-about-what-im-doing/&#34; title=&#34;The Unity enshittification, proprietary tech dangers, and mostly not talking about what I‚Äôm doing.&#34;&gt;week of anxiety,&lt;/a&gt; for thousands and thousands of developers, Unity &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee&#34;&gt;changed the rules again&lt;/a&gt;, and first glance, it‚Äôs better for the immediate problems it would cause for active and in-development games. They removed the retroactive aspect of the ‚Äúpay-per-game-install‚Äù, so only for someone on Unity 2023 LTS+ (launching next year) will that apply, current projects will not be affected. Small relief, as long as we can keep using existing versions with current Terms of Service. This will be impossible on mobile and consoles in a short time frame due to SDKs, but for PC should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After mostly a <a href="/2023/09/the-unity-enshittification-proprietary-tech-dangers-and-mostly-not-talking-about-what-im-doing/" title="The Unity enshittification, proprietary tech dangers, and mostly not talking about what I‚Äôm doing.">week of anxiety,</a> for thousands and thousands of developers, Unity <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee">changed the rules again</a>, and first glance, it‚Äôs better for the immediate problems it would cause for active and in-development games. They removed the retroactive aspect of the ‚Äúpay-per-game-install‚Äù, so only for someone on Unity 2023 LTS+ (launching next year) will that apply, current projects will not be affected. Small relief, as long as we can keep using existing versions with current Terms of Service. This will be impossible on mobile and consoles in a short time frame due to SDKs, but for PC should be fine.</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs good huh? Well not quite imo, because the rest pretty much maintains, more or less with some changes, Unity Plus still gone (although expected), but <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates">it‚Äôs a revenue/pay-per-install deal</a>, on top of the yearly license fees. I feel they fear they tainted their image so much they aren‚Äôt even forcing the Unity splash screen anymore, probably because players will now fear every Unity game will come with install tracking software.</p>
<p>I think the subscription plan, especially for mobile/consoles is needed, it‚Äôs a company and needs to make money to maintain the software, fair. However for me it‚Äôs a lot of the break of trust they did, and trying for the SECOND time (that I recall) to change the Terms of Service retroactively and only after industry-wide outrage did they backtracked slightly. So for now the new-new rules only apply to a smaller %, which I guess they expect will calm down most of the community. In a couple years they‚Äôll pull some other stunt and we‚Äôll recall ‚Äúoh right, they did this before‚Äù.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they had deleted the transparency repo with the Terms of Service from GitHub, which raised many eyebrows, when enquired to why they deleted the answer was ‚Äúlow views so it was deleted‚Äù. The repo is back up meanwhile, I mean, what the heck?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1705317639478751611"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-2.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
<p>So as I mentioned in last post I have been working on a prototype for what I hope I can turn into a new game, in Unity. I decided that I‚Äôll continue working on the prototype in Unity (actually taking a break from work right now to write this), it would be slightly silly to change now. And when I feel most of the features are done, I‚Äôll try to move to my own tech, yes again.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been doing some research and tests and I‚Äôll be dismantling <a href="/tags/quest-of-dungeons/" title="Quest of Dungeons development update">Quest of Dungeons</a> engine, which was all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, to adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/">Flecs</a>, this is a major thing I‚Äôm taking with me from my time using Unity, I like that it helps solving a lot of issues sometimes, even if full ECS is not the solution for me. But having that will be nice, I can see the benefit now. Another thing might also be trying to mimick Prefabs and/or ScriptableObjects, that would be nice, but that‚Äôs just in the back of my head at the moment. I already started the process of integrating Flecs, so slowly and gradually, and hopefully, when it‚Äôs time to switch engine it will be a suitable alternative. If not well, better not update to 2023LTS I guess.</p>
<p>At least this is the plan right now, who knows, maybe I‚Äôll reach a point where it feels too frustrating to rewrite it all in a different engine and language (c# to cpp), or ran out of budget to do so, plans do change. But at the moment at least it moves forward like this.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-mostly-open-source-game-engines-and-frameworks">List of mostly open-source game engines and frameworks</h2>
<p>Using suggestions I compiled a list of game engines and frameworks, mostly open-source and free, but there are a few with licenses, regardless, for anyone looking to test alternatives, there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DJLink/list-of-game-engines-and-frameworks">https://github.com/DJLink/list-of-game-engines-and-frameworks</a></p>
<p>My personal suggestion for anyone who wants to try the ‚Äúmake my own engine‚Äù approach, for 2D stuff (don‚Äôt get too deep the rabbit hole on 3D), will be to use SDL to bootstrap window creation, input etc. I‚Äôve used that in a bunch of stuff in the past and can vouch for it.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this was an ‚Äúeventful‚Äù week in the game dev community. &lt;a href=&#34;https://unity.com/&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most well know, and used game engines out there, after years of doing mostly good for the community, pulled a reverse card and broke years of trust the community had on them. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates&#34;&gt;Unity announced &lt;/a&gt;that they are retroactively charging (for example $0.2) for each game install, after developers hit a certain yearly revenue threshold, which sounds insane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So this was an ‚Äúeventful‚Äù week in the game dev community. <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, one of the most well know, and used game engines out there, after years of doing mostly good for the community, pulled a reverse card and broke years of trust the community had on them. <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates">Unity announced </a>that they are retroactively charging (for example $0.2) for each game install, after developers hit a certain yearly revenue threshold, which sounds insane.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/unity-new-runtime-free-pricing-image.png"></a></p>
<p>Also they are removing the Plus subscription, which honestly this one I was kind of expecting for a while now. Which means a lot of people would have to jump to the nearly $2k yearly subscriptions. This on it‚Äôs own, while a big jump, at least is more understandable, building tech is expensive. The pay-per-install is crazy though.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DJ_Link/status/1666532480646627329"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png"></a>On top of all, the thing that breaks trust the most, is the retroactive thing, games already released on older versions will be affected. The Terms of Service for those older versions, which developers agreed on installing X version, are no longer valid, they changed them, which means it‚Äôs no longer safe to trust the rules, Unity can just flip them. What‚Äôs for tomorrow?</p>
<h2 id="proprietary-tech">Proprietary tech</h2>
<p>This is, and always be one of the downsides of depending on other people technology, if the whole company depends on it, and there‚Äôs no easy replacement, a drastic change can hurt the whole business bad. This is not to say that we must avoid it 100% of the time, but it clearly shows that if a company amasses too much power, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">murphy‚Äôs law</a>!</p>
<p>I usually like to discuss this subject, even before this whole thing, not because I think everyone should do custom engines (even if fun) but because we shouldn‚Äôt trick ourselves in believing ‚Äúmy choice of engine is forever!‚Äù, it won‚Äôt be, unless it‚Äôs our own tech that we spend tons of time supporting/improving it, everything else eventually mutates too much, fades or gets killed. So we should always try to at the very least, be mentally prepared.</p>
<p>A very large amount of developers probably entered gamedev through Unity, it was mostly the goto suggestion everyone gave, and never tried anything else (and why would they, if it worked right?), but after years of learning that tool, it might be frustrating to change, but trust me, you got this. It will be hard, but if you ever change again it will be easier.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-up-to">What I‚Äôm up to</h2>
<p>Personally I‚Äôve been using Unity for the ~5 years maybe, mostly for contract work and porting stuff. But recently, and after years of shipping stuff on <a href="/tags/basalt/">custom framework</a> I decided to work on my current game prototype in Unity, it made sense, my day work is 80% on that tech, built in Editor, multi-platform, so I would also be learning more and prototyping in Unity is generally quite fun. But these changes now mean I‚Äôll be changing for something else, not because these rules will affect me, I don‚Äôt see ever reaching the $200k yearly, but because I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll do next. I‚Äôd rather risk elsewhere.</p>
<h4 id="what-next">What next?</h4>
<p>For the past couple days I‚Äôve trying to decide on exactly where, but haven‚Äôt made my mind yet. But I have decided that I‚Äôll at least try to wrap up the prototype phase in Unity, makes sense, game is still a bit barebones (why I‚Äôm not talking about it yet) but there‚Äôs a lot done, so I‚Äôd rather pass the whole ‚Äútoy prototyping messy code‚Äù in Unity, and when it feels time to move to production port the whole thing elsewhere and in the process hopefully have a cleaner code base.</p>
<p>Custom or another engine I‚Äôm unsure, but atm I‚Äôm leaning more towards custom, but that would mean I‚Äôd probably either reshape my entire custom engine, or do from scratch, reason being, it‚Äôs 100% object oriented, and while working with Unity I discovered there‚Äôs tons of advantages to the Entity Component System, so I want that on my framework. Might be more initial setup, but after shipping a couple games on tons of platforms in OOP, I discovered that some of the issues would have been easier to solve with ECS, not all but several.</p>
<p>Overall I‚Äôm excited about the possibility of working on my own tech, because well, it‚Äôs fun. As for my next game, progress has been slow, because I‚Äôm still taking the approach of contract work, and working on it on my spare time until it feels like a viable project and deciding full or part-time.</p>
<p>After working on Quest of Dungeons for many years (which I‚Äôm grateful) I did several prototypes that were, to be honest, not good games, and I will never ship something that at the very least I don‚Äôt find fun, so yeah sorry it‚Äôs been a while. The hope is that if I find it fun, more people will, so until that time, work moves on, maybe I‚Äôll have more news about something sooner than later.</p>

&lt;p&gt;With the recent Twitter purchase, change of ownership and rules, a lot of people are leaving the platform or just searching for alternatives. Among other platforms one that keeps showing up as an alternative is &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinmastodon.org/&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, but change is always hard, some people have been on Twitter for years, so what exactly makes this any different?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>With the recent Twitter purchase, change of ownership and rules, a lot of people are leaving the platform or just searching for alternatives. Among other platforms one that keeps showing up as an alternative is <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, but change is always hard, some people have been on Twitter for years, so what exactly makes this any different?</p>
<hr>
<p>I created a Mastodon back in 2018 but never really payed much attention to it, I have to be honest, there weren‚Äôt as many people using it back then, I lost interest a bit fast, and I never really got past the ‚Äújust another social network‚Äù. But recently things changed, a LOT of people have joined, it feels more alive, and I started to look more into the decentralised nature of it, which is the opposite of Twitter centralised, and one of it‚Äôs best weapons at keeping ppl stuck there, you‚Äôve build up a network, if you leave, it‚Äôs all gone.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ok so right now one of the problems with Twitter is, either you agree with how things are or not, but your profile is locked on that platform, if you leave all is gone, followers, posts etc, you start from scratch elsewhere. This was never particularly too much of any issue until now, I wanna keep in touch with people I follow, updates on their work, they are leaving, ideally I should be able to follow them if they leave twitter server, regardless if I wanna move or not.</p>
<p>But let‚Äôs start by the similarities, on Mastodon you can make posts (the tweets), follow people, be followed, make lists, search hashtags, post pictures etc, on the surface level, give or take, it‚Äôs more or less the same, but Mastodon gives us more control on a couple levels, but one of the best features might be the decentralisation.</p>
<p>And this is were the big differences show up, Mastodon doesn‚Äôt exist in a single place, Twitter entry point is twitter.com, everyone logins there, and everything is there, if Twitter closes tomorrow, they own all the data, everything is gone.</p>
<p>But with Mastodon anyone can make a new server, based on interests, topics, workplace, whatever. By now you might be asking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But that just means everyone is a different place, multiple servers, where do I join, that sounds too much work, what if I join a server with few people or that stagnates?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All good questions, which I made myself, but here‚Äôs where the decentralised part enters, all Mastodon servers talk with each other, so you can follow people from any server, get their notifications and talk with them, regardless of where you created your account, they are all connected. On top of that, you can migrate your account to different servers if you don‚Äôt agree with any new rules, it‚Äôs too crowded, or too empty or you just wanna go to a new one, you can even run your own server, just your account, and never be isolated, I‚Äôm following 3 people who run their own instance, and it doesn‚Äôt matter.</p>
<p>The server you choose matters for the Local Timeline, where you see a feed of all updates from anyone in the server you choose, so in my case, I joined the <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place">https://mastodon.gamedev.place</a> and I see a local timeline with a lot of gamedev content, but there is also a Federated tab, which shows updates from all Mastadon instances, like a ‚Äúglobal feed‚Äù list.</p>
<p>So we have 3 levels:</p>
<p>‚Äì<strong>The people you follow</strong>: doesn‚Äôt matter which server they are on, you‚Äôll see their stuff.<br>
‚Äì<strong>The Local Feed</strong>: here it will matter the server you pick, you see content of all people in your server, but don‚Äôt worry, don‚Äôt like it? Move your account to another one.<br>
‚Äì<strong>The Federated Feed</strong>: Posts from people in from the whole network related to the people you follow.</p>
<p>But you can just see the people you follow of course, you have a lot of control, nothing forces you to see stuff from people you don‚Äôt follow.</p>
<p>All this together has been very interesting to me, because that means as we grow a userbase on Mastodon, if somewhere in the future we are unhappy with the server picked, we can move, create our own and still keep our data, just elsewhere, still following the same people. It‚Äôs a different kind of concept which has tremendous potential in a future where we want to be more and more in control of our own data.</p>
<p><strong>So how to migrate from Twitter to Mastodon?</strong></p>
<p>If people you are following created Mastodon accounts there are a few tools you can use to find them, these will search their bios for Mastodon links, or even if someone you follow on Twitter used the same tool to search, which means they have an account. I used these and found several people I was following, as time passes more will join so running the tools in a couple weeks will probably bring more results. After you use it, it will export a .csv file which you can use to import on Mastodon, don‚Äôt forget to use ‚Äúmerge‚Äù and not ‚Äúreplace‚Äù.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mastodon_importer.png">I‚Äôm not leaving Twitter for now, but I‚Äôm actively using Mastodon, can‚Äôt hurt, and it‚Äôs kind of exciting, I‚Äôm meeting a ton of new developers. I‚Äôm also using a Mastodon to Twitter cross poster <a href="https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/">https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br</a>, which makes all my tweets post on Mastodon as well. You can control not to post RTs for example, which might look weird on Mastodon and vice versa.</p>

      <title>Merged personal and studio blogs into one</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2022/11/merged-personal-and-studio-blogs-into-one/</link>

      <guid>https://www.david-amador.com/2022/11/merged-personal-and-studio-blogs-into-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how many people, if any, are still subscribed to this blog RSS feeds, but if they are, they probably saw a couple of new posts in burst yesterday, apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened because I decided to merge all the posts from my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.upfallstudios.com&#34; title=&#34;Upfall Studios link&#34;&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt; into this one for ‚Äúcleaning house‚Äù. I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a while that I have these 2 blogs mostly abandoned and it‚Äôs a shame, I used to be very active, but IRL stuff and especially Twitter and QoD launch got me busy elsewhere and I mostly abandoned blogging, which I enjoyed a lot. It felt like the audiences were in other places so it made more sense. Upfall Studios blog was mostly created as I felt it needed to have a more professional look for the devlogs of all the ports I made, and it helped doing that, explaining the new features, it was a place for players to see the roadmap, and blogs are perfect for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no idea how many people, if any, are still subscribed to this blog RSS feeds, but if they are, they probably saw a couple of new posts in burst yesterday, apologies.</p>
<p>This happened because I decided to merge all the posts from my <a href="https://www.upfallstudios.com" title="Upfall Studios link">studio</a> into this one for ‚Äúcleaning house‚Äù. I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a while that I have these 2 blogs mostly abandoned and it‚Äôs a shame, I used to be very active, but IRL stuff and especially Twitter and QoD launch got me busy elsewhere and I mostly abandoned blogging, which I enjoyed a lot. It felt like the audiences were in other places so it made more sense. Upfall Studios blog was mostly created as I felt it needed to have a more professional look for the devlogs of all the ports I made, and it helped doing that, explaining the new features, it was a place for players to see the roadmap, and blogs are perfect for that.</p>
<p>Twitter is still a place that I enjoy (even if less these days) doing little silly posts but I‚Äôd like to revive an alternative, and I now had these 2 blogs that only I post, one for more personal stuff, the other for work stuff, maintaining both is probably not a good idea in the long run, so I moved all the studio blog posts here, so they can still exist, and redirected everything under upfallstudios.com/blog/ to this domain, under a <a href="/categories/upfall-studios/" title="Upfall Studios Blog Category">Upfall Studios category</a>, I 301 the URLS there via .htaccess, I hope I covered all, so everyone following old links should be redirected here for the blog content, there might be some weird broken images (I found a few and fixed) since WordPress is kinda weird with importing, so for any future game updates, tech stuff, or roadmaps I‚Äôll use this space.</p>
<p>This blog has a lot of content, which for most part is now outdated (most of my XNA stuff) but I‚Äôll keep it alive as long as I can, like a diary.</p>
<hr>
<p>With the recent Twitter changes there seems to be a lot of people unhappy and wanting to try other stuff, like CoHost, which I investigated a bit, looks like a cool mini blog sort of social network, reminded me a bit about Medium, which just reminded me again ‚ÄúDavid, you HAVE a blog, just use it‚Äù. I think the new rules of websites requiring the ‚Äúmust gather followers‚Äù for helping reach more people has conditioned me a lot, and usually is the thing that I (and probably more people) look into when evaluating any social website, the growth potential. But it doesn‚Äôt always have to be about that, and blogs have served me well in the past to talk about something or pass a message.</p>
<hr>
<p>In terms of work related stuff I‚Äôll do a more detailed post eventually, but I‚Äôve been very busy with contract work, since a while before the pandemic started in March 2020, I‚Äôve been working in porting games to consoles, Unity and GameMaker 2, it has been a very interesting learning experience. I really like coding my own frameworks (heck this whole blog is mostly about that kind stuff), but it has been interesting to code on other engines, take inspiration, see tools that work in new modern paradigms, tech moves so fast that it‚Äôs easy to stand still, and using these tools has re-think a lot of things, that I would probably approach different the next time I decide to ‚Äúcode from scratch‚Äù.</p>
<p>Unity has made me go back again to C#, which was my main language during XNA time (how I miss it), and after a few years of C++ I sort of missed some of it‚Äôs things, that C++ still complicates often, even if it‚Äôs better these days.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well that‚Äôs it for now, this ran a bit longer than I anticipated, I just wanted to update on the blog merge, for any possible visitors. If you are still around thank you so much, I‚Äôll see you next time.</p>
<p>PS: I have no idea if the comment section still works, I should test it myself to see if it does. (I should probably shape up the presentation of the site when I find the time, a lot of stuff got broken over the years, might not be suitable for mobile devices either.</p>

However I‚Äôve been trying to work on something new and gotta get back to more regular blogging, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, but not least important, Vizati is turning 10 years old today (11 June 2010), feels only yesterday we (me coding and &lt;a href=&#34;http://rita-silva.com/&#34; title=&#34;rita-silva.com/&#34;&gt;Rita&lt;/a&gt; with the art) were doing the first puzzles and trying to figure out the best way for making this a fun game. Things changed a lot over the years and the original team is no longer working together, also because of OS updates, like the iOS versions etc or hardware not being around anymore the game has mostly vanished from all stores. The other day I was thinking about game preservation and thought it would be a shame to leave this only in our computers, combined with the 10th anniversary we decided to make it free to everyone, the original game can now be downloaded and played even on the newest Windows versions (thank you XNA).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Here‚Äôs the official <a href="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati" title="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati">itch.io</a> page, there you‚Äôll find not only the original XNA version that was being sold, but also an unfinished version using a custom engine that I build when porting it to iOS, this framework ended up powering <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com" title="https://www.questofdungeons.com">Quest of Dungeons</a>, a game I made a few years after. It‚Äôs not finished but should be mostly playable, although only works in window mode.</p>
<p>I also created a GitHub repo, which has a couple more things, like the original website code, some screenshots, the code using for creating the XNA installer, PDF manual and a couple more things. This way those things will never get lost in case my computer + backups ever go bad.</p>

<p>Hope you have fun, either you are rediscovering the game or playing it for the first time, it‚Äôs a product of it‚Äôs time, from an inexperienced team trying to make their first indie game, but I‚Äôm proud of how it turned out.</p>

      <title>Some thoughts about a 4 year game dev cycle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôm starting to write this post I‚Äôm on my way to my home town for the holidays, so I may not post it in a couple days.&lt;br&gt;
It‚Äôs been a crazy year(s)(?) and I‚Äôm taking these near 4h of travel to write down some things. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs incoherent, this is mostly a dump of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who follow my work a bit more closely you probably know that for almost 4 years the project I dedicated more time was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.questofdungeons.com&#34;&gt;Quest of Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, which started development in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I‚Äôm starting to write this post I‚Äôm on my way to my home town for the holidays, so I may not post it in a couple days.<br>
It‚Äôs been a crazy year(s)(?) and I‚Äôm taking these near 4h of travel to write down some things. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs incoherent, this is mostly a dump of thoughts.</p>
<p>For those who follow my work a bit more closely you probably know that for almost 4 years the project I dedicated more time was <a href="http://www.questofdungeons.com">Quest of Dungeons</a>, which started development in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> I still have one more platform to release, on Playstation 4, 17 January 2017, it passed certification, ready to be released, so for the first time in years it feels that my QoD journey is finally completing. I still intend to patch the Android port with all last updates and sure, there will always be patches and things to take care of, but it will be in a whole different way now. Until now it always felt incomplete and a never ending task that extended for months, years.</p>
<p><strong>Working for so much time</strong> on the same project can be incredibly frustrating, especially if working alone, so one thing that I‚Äôm proud of myself is that I actually finished it. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the amount of times that I said ‚ÄúF** it, is not worth it‚Äù. Things went good with the game, in a sense that I was able to put it on a lot of platforms and it was well received for the most part.<br>
I think I was able to find a good ‚Äúniche‚Äù of players that understood what QoD was all about, with all its flaws and good things.</p>
<p>The game was never meant to be released outside of PC, heck, during the first month of development it was a Tablet only game. That led to decisions that I regretted later when porting to consoles, but also allowed me to cut corners and not caring about things that weren‚Äôt meant for a PC game early on, thus speeding up development time. I spent a lot of time just rethinking the whole interface for each new platform (except PS4 which is identical to Xbox One) and that is time consuming, not to mention specific console features, on the other hand players do feel like it was hand-crafted for their device, so there‚Äôs that. Each new platform was made possible with the previous one, so it‚Äôs not something that I can say it was a total mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Technology wise</strong>, I‚Äôve kept using my own tech for all releases, stubbornness perhaps? And that is not without it‚Äôs caveats. With engines like Unreal 4, Unity and Gamemaker these days if feels almost ridiculous to consider building your own tech for many, but not for me, not yet anyway. I used other engines in the past, I did release my first 2 games on XNA, and after that I decided that it was time to build my own tech, so I could be more flexible and not caring if an engine is discontinued or not, that was the goal. And on that part it succeeded, the same code runs on all platforms, except for specific render, input, etc. It took work, a lot, and after so many platforms I have a better idea of things that need better abstraction, in fact for the past week I‚Äôve been just cleaning up code for future projects, feels more robust now. But I have a bit of regret of platforms that I ported the engine and possibly will never use it again, like Wii U, maybe even Nintendo 3DS. While the others, now that the work is done I can reuse for future games, it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôll never use for some again, so it was an effort for a one time only, and that is a problem, one that could have been prevented by using an existent engine.<br>
I tried using Unity for 3 weeks, did some tests with GameMaker, and it was a cool experience, knowledge doesn‚Äôt hurt right? But haven‚Äôt made my mind yet about switching away from my own tech, mostly because I know it well, I can quickly changes things around for each project and mostly because I love working on that part as well, it‚Äôs fun, even if it‚Äôs just for me. I‚Äôll revisit this if/when I need to switch to a ‚Äúfull 3d‚Äù game.</p>
<p><strong>So many platforms!!</strong><br>
It‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs on a lot of devices now, and there are several reasons to do so, more audience, chance to make more money, get the game more known, etc, brand recognition and proving the studio is capable of delivering. I also made it because I had the chance right now, I don‚Äôt know the future, may not be able to pull that again, also it was a chance to establish a relation with Steam, Xbox, Nintendo and Sony. My idea is to keep making games for platforms that each makes sense, but trying to cut down time between each release. It was too sparse now, because of the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> is still something I suck at, I do have a twitter account where I talk about my games, but also about tons of other stuff, mostly movies and general day things, is that even called marketing? Too late I decided to setup a newsletter list and put it on Upfall Studios website, should have done it earlier, I got 100 people to subscribe in the last year and half, I could have way more in these nearly 7 years as indie dev.<br>
I also created a twitter account for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/UpfallStudios">Upfall Studios</a>, so it‚Äôs basically a cleaned up version of my own, just news about the games and launches, a more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù account I call it. Taking care of so many social stuff, twitter, facebook, etc is time consuming and doesn‚Äôt come to me as naturally as using my personal account, so that is still a problem probably. For the most part I follow devs and not ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù even when they are indies, so that‚Äôs mostly what I like to do, chances are there are more people like me.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong> (love you guys)<br>
I like responding to people, I don‚Äôt mind getting asked questions and I‚Äôve answered to 100% of emails I got, either about the game or gamedev in general. I‚Äôve taken time to meet other developers in person when they wanna ask me questions. Treat others the way you wanna be treated, easy right?<br>
I‚Äôve been extremely luck with the players and community surrounding QoD, they are nice, active in recommending the game to friends and I couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better community. Goal is to keep incrementing the amount of course =)<br>
Never lie or go on radio silence regarding customers. There are tons of Early access games that suddenly stop and not even a goodbye post, that‚Äôs the worse part, the waiting for months to see if project is alive. They won‚Äôt trust you again, even if you switch to a different studio, they won‚Äôt forget. So if project fails explain it, if you are delayed on a patch say so. Almost all the time players will understand and be supportive. When I was making the Xbox One and Nintendo ports I had to delay the PC updates for a couple months and players were really supportive, as long as they know why you are late on some promise.</p>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs never just ‚ÄúX more months of dev‚Äù</strong><br>
NEVER, ever, if you think it‚Äôs just 2 more months, odds are that it‚Äôs 4 more. We suck at calculating time for the most part (or at least I do), because we conceive the game in your minds and you can see it, mostly complete, but making that happen takes much more time. PC version was delayed, both Xbox and Nintendo ports took much longer than I expected, the PS4 one was shorted, because I counted with worst case scenario but things went well at first try. In my experience completing the game 1-2 months before the release can have a positive effect, especially for a 1 man team. I finished the Xbox One version 2 months before, full approved on certification, and spent that time just trying to promote it, and was able to gather some awareness for the game. I finished the Nintendo versions just 10 days before, and even had to delay the game once, I regret now that I didn‚Äôt calculated/handled things better. Lesson learned, let‚Äôs see if I don‚Äôt make that mistake again.</p>
<p><strong>Everything else</strong><br>
I made that mistake in the past and I still do, I can‚Äôt separate well development time and actual life time, so I end up working too many hours, and it‚Äôs addicting.<br>
QoD was made partially at night when I still had a day job, and the last 1 and a half year in full time, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I was able to do twice as much work unfortunately.<br>
When you work for someone else you have a schedule, but if you work on your own time, it‚Äôs harder. Most people tell me it‚Äôs hard to stay focused working, and I have that problem too, but not in a way that I can‚Äôt work, but mostly because I blend in leisure time with work, and working from home doesn‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs easy to get distracted, then you feel guilty and spend a couple more hours working. And while I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm super slow, I could be using my time better. That‚Äôs something I want to change, I don‚Äôt thing strict work schedules work well, but not having clear boundaries doesn‚Äôt either. If anyone is managing this well please let me know. Open to suggestions üôÇ<br>
It‚Äôs easy to find people saying this, but I‚Äôve now experienced it myself, when you have a problem that you can‚Äôt solve don‚Äôt spend hours on the PC, take a walk, go do something else, the solution will come to mind, seriously, it works very often. You trick your mind into something else and the other problem keeps getting solved in the background.</p>
<p><strong>What now?</strong><br>
In approximately 3 weeks the PS4 version will be released, I don‚Äôt any plans for more ports so I intend to move to a new game, and honestly I‚Äôm scared, I don‚Äôt have a solid idea yet, been mostly sketching ideas or trying some prototypes, and the thought of deciding ‚Äúlet me spend 1-2 years‚Äù in this new game is a bit scary, ‚Äúcan I come up with all the money?‚Äù, ‚Äúwill it be good?‚Äù.<br>
I wish I had a small cool idea to try for a couple months instead of a bigger one, but as I mentioned before, QoD was also supposed to be a 6 months project that turned out into 4 years so better not force anything. I‚Äôm trying not to think of ‚Äúthis is gonna be a cool idea that everyone will like‚Äù and instead trying to come up again with something that I would like to play, even if others don‚Äôt like it, development flows more naturally like that.<br>
Oh and I want to take 2 weeks of proper vacations after the PS4 release, haven‚Äôt had vacations in over two years, thinking of backpacking a couple countries, it‚Äôs cheaper and it‚Äôs good ‚Äúmind food‚Äù-</p>
<p>Still there? thanks for reading ‚Äì David</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost new year again.&lt;br&gt;
It became a habit of mine to to hit pause for a couple minutes, look back, write about it and think about what‚Äôs next, this helps me to sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have to start with something, a big Thank You for all the people who purchased QoD, everyone who helped spreading the word, the ones who wrote emails, tweeted and help my solo developer work became an even better thing to do. This wouldn‚Äôt be possible without everyone who supported me, in one way or another, so even if I do work a lot to make the best possible I can, if no one cared, it wouldn‚Äôt be possible, so thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Thank you</strong><br>

<p><strong>Indie life</strong><br>
I took the jump to full time indie developer this year again, back in March, it wasn‚Äôt something I was planning, but was semi forced to do because of some internal restructuring the company was having, so I left. With the <a href="/2014/12/im-a-xbox-one-developer-now-qod-getting-a-port/">Xbox One port of Quest of Dungeons</a> in hands, and falling behind on my personal deadlines, I decided to risk take a couple months and finish it. One one hand I have more freedom, and can work on games, on the other hand there‚Äôs the constant fear of ‚Äúthis is the last month‚Äù if everything fails and games stop selling. I also decided to start taking care of myself health-wise, by exercising more regularly, and for the most part of the year I did almost everyday a 6-8 KM fast-paced walk right after waking up, overall I fell much better, which helps with the mood and work altogether. The weird thing is that I had to get a gadget in order to feel more motivated, got a fitbit that tracks daily activity, been wearing it for 10 months now, so gamificating health ftw. Personal note, take some proper vacations next year, and by proper I mean, in any place, but disconnected from emails/work and whatever.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/944873_10156260342525364_3728126092064434364_n.jpg"><img alt="i find your lack of faith distrurbing" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/944873_10156260342525364_3728126092064434364_n-150x150.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>QoD on Xbox One</strong><br>
When I left in March, I was already way behind on my original launch plans, because developing for a console is a whole different thing and doing it during nights only was quickly draining my energies.<br>
The following months were mainly devoted to finishing the game, I had to redo a lot of the UI and gameplay to <a href="/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/">accommodate a game controller and other stuff</a>, but eventually on September 4 I <a href="/2015/09/quest-of-dungeons-is-now-available-on-xbox-one/">finally released it</a> and I was genuinely surprised by the overwhelming <a href="/2015/10/quest-of-dungeons-reviews-roundup/">positive feedback</a>, since, at that point the game was out for some time in its PC and Mobile form, but the new additions/changes and the fact that you could play it with a controller for the first time made it more appealing for many people.</p>
<p>Looking back, it took me a full year, from getting the game approved to the actual release. While it‚Äôs a lot of time, I also think it was worth it, a lot of the game was tweaked, also for some part I still had my day job, certifications take some time also. In fact the final build was finished around June, I just took those ‚Äúextra‚Äù months to finding bugs/polishing and start to approach journalists/websites.</p>

<p><strong>GDC/Gamescom</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I‚Äôve always wanted to attend, at least once, was GDC (Game Developers Conference), and this year I was finally able to, to the European one, which despite being expensive, is still less expensive then traveling to the US. And of course since it‚Äôs on the same week, I also went to Gamescom, and it was amazing, it‚Äôs much bigger then <a href="/2014/10/egx-2014/">EGX</a>, I had no idea. During GDC I was able to meet tons of cool developers, attend some parties (which is usually not my thing) and learn a lot overall.<br>
I was also able to watch a Video Games Live concert for the first time, and I loved it, even got a photo with Tommy Tallarico.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11800512_10155811214270364_267427683833702867_n.jpg"><img alt="Gamescom 2015" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11800512_10155811214270364_267427683833702867_n-150x150.jpg"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11866409_10155826026945364_3741151929249482381_n.jpg"><img alt="Video Games Live 2015 Koln" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11866409_10155826026945364_3741151929249482381_n-150x150.jpg"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11866259_10155826026335364_4527137215117046469_n.jpg"><img alt="Video Games Live 2015 Koln" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11866259_10155826026335364_4527137215117046469_n-150x150.jpg"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11828828_10155803526680364_299957432295330404_n.jpg"><img alt="GDC Europe 2015" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11828828_10155803526680364_299957432295330404_n-150x150.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>Now &amp; Future(?)</strong></p>
<p>With the release of the XO version, a lot of people are asking what am I doing right now, ‚ÄúAre you on vacation?‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew game?‚Äù. I can definitely say that I‚Äôm not on vacation mode right now, I‚Äôm already working on something for next year, which is kind of a semi-secret right now, mostly because I‚Äôm still unsure if I can pull it off. I started working on a concept for a new game, but something unexpected came up and it‚Äôs possible that Quest of Dungeons will get a new port, but now is not the time to talk about it, because at this point is not 100% sure it will, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working on now.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Back_to_the_Future_time_travel_test_with_Michael_J._Fox_as_Marty_McFly.jpg"><img alt="Back to the Future (1985) Directed by Robert Zemeckis Shown from left: Christopher Lloyd (as Dr. Emmett Brown), Michael J.

<p>On a final note, another thing that comes to mind is that I‚Äôve been blogging way less, I used to post a lot more stuff, especially tutorials of some kind, and I haven‚Äôt, so one of the things I wanna change is to write at least one post a month next year. It happened very little this year because I‚Äôve been mostly working with NDA stuff and it‚Äôs hard to ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how I fixed this‚Äù.</p>
<p>Happy New year!</p>

Can‚Äôt even believe the amount of things that happened to me this year, some bad, some good, I decided to make a wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was been a great year for my game dev objectives. In January I got &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/02/quest-of-dungeons-approved-on-steam/&#34; title=&#34;Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam&#34;&gt;Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam&lt;/a&gt; in only 6 days, which was mind blowing, on March 25th I finally got it released, and during the rest of the year several other platforms got a port, like Linux and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/&#34; title=&#34;Native game on Android ‚Äì Porting Quest of Dungeons&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, both platforms that I never had worked before, so I learned a lot. Finally on October I got QoD &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/10/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-xbox-one/&#34;&gt;approved for Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This was been a great year for my game dev objectives. In January I got <a href="/2014/02/quest-of-dungeons-approved-on-steam/" title="Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam">Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam</a> in only 6 days, which was mind blowing, on March 25th I finally got it released, and during the rest of the year several other platforms got a port, like Linux and <a href="/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/" title="Native game on Android ‚Äì Porting Quest of Dungeons">Android</a>, both platforms that I never had worked before, so I learned a lot. Finally on October I got QoD <a href="/2014/10/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-xbox-one/">approved for Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be at <a href="/2014/10/egx-2014/" title="EGX 2014">EGX 2014 in London</a>, I loved it, this was my first time on such an event and I was amazed by everything, even more because I got to meet so many cool people, and other developers who I‚Äôve been following their work for years.</p>
<p>Also I created a new brand for my indie games, called <a href="http://www.upfallstudios.com">Upfall Studios</a>, in order to give it a more professional look.</p>
<p>Not everything is good and this year I got a glimpse of what happens when you push yourself for years, I‚Äôve been making games for quite some time now, switching between working on them full time or splitting with a day job (gotta pay rent), around February I collapsed, ended up in the hospital and had to take a 2 week sick leave, it was not pretty. So resolution for next year, taking care of myself better, work less but more efficiently.</p>
<p>It was kind of a weird year in gaming for me, I skipped the Wii completely (last generation was the Xbox 360) but for this generation I got the WiiU, which I love btw, and I started having that nostalgia feeling and playing older games, in fact I spent Christmas playing Super Mario World and Mario RPG on my SNES.</p>
<p><em>Some of the coolest games</em>:</p>
<p>Shovel Knight<br>
Crypt of the Necrodancer<br>
Nuclear Throne<br>
Mario Kart 8<br>
The Last of Us Remastered<br>
Bayonetta<br>
Super Mario 3D World<br>
Alien Isolation</p>
<p><em>Movies</em>:<br>
Guardians on the Galaxy<br>
OMG GO SEE INTERSTELLAR RIGHT NOW!!</p>
<p><em>TV Shows</em>:<br>
True Detective</p>
<p><em>(there are several other, this is just a very small curated list)</em></p>
<p>I have to idea what 2015 holds but I‚Äôm looking forward to it, the plans so far are to finish the Xbox One port and start working on the next project.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a lot has happened since my last post. Even before &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/10/egx-2014/&#34; title=&#34;EGX 2014&#34;&gt;EGX&lt;/a&gt; I was already in talks with Microsoft for becoming a Xbox One developer and maybe get Quest of Dungeons to XO. I was extremely happy when they accepted both, so right now I‚Äôm working on porting the game to Xbox One.&lt;br&gt;
I don‚Äôt think this would have been possible without all the gamers that have played and are still playing the game, that‚Äôs what brought all the positive vibe surrounding the game, so a big thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Since pushing on making games with just displaying my name felt a bit weird I decided (a couple months ago) to give a brand to my indie games, called <a href="http://www.upfallstudios.com">Upfall Studios</a>. Looks a bit more professional and it‚Äôs easier to approach other people, because either we like it or not, this is a business and people always ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the studio name?‚Äù.</p>
<p><del>I also created a blog (<a href="http://www.upfallstudios.com/">http://www.upfallstudios.com/</a>) where I‚Äôll be talking about the games and development, which is something I usually don‚Äôt do here in much dept, is mostly ‚Äúnew game‚Äù, ‚Äúgame is out‚Äù, so if you want to keep track of that feel free.</del></p>
<p>Edit 2024: I&rsquo;ve since <a href="/2022/11/merged-personal-and-studio-blogs-into-one/">merged the upfallstudios blog onto this one</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm forcing myself to do a year summary post soon so see you soon.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the chance of going to EGX in London this year with Quest of Dungeons.&lt;br&gt;
The whole show lasted 4 days and it was AMAZING, met tons of players, and a lot of developers. Everyone was super friendly, so I had a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I did something like this, so it was a very good way to get feedback and talk in person with players and even some fans of the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.questofdungeons.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Quest of Dungeons&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.questofdungeons.com/imgs/icon.png&#34;&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is finally out.&lt;br&gt;
I didn‚Äôt get to make a post on day one, and it‚Äôs been nearly two weeks since launch but these past 2 weeks have been one crazy roller coaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was released on March 25th, for PC, Mac and iOS. You can get it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/270050&#34;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id698726956/&#34;&gt;iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; or directly from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.questofdungeons.com/&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; via Humble Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I released all platforms on the same day, which was something I always wanted to try, and I have to say that it didn‚Äôt went as bad as I thought. As some of you know I have a day job so I had to take 2 vacation days to simple answer emails and do quick fixes, especially to the PC/Mac version. With each new software is natural to have problems at launch and Quest of Dungeons was no exception, and right now I‚Äôm still working on a daily basis in fixing some stuff and attending to some popular requests/changes from players to the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I‚Äôm pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is finally out.<br>
I didn‚Äôt get to make a post on day one, and it‚Äôs been nearly two weeks since launch but these past 2 weeks have been one crazy roller coaster.</p>
<p>It was released on March 25th, for PC, Mac and iOS. You can get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270050">Steam</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id698726956/">iOS App Store</a> or directly from the <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com/">site</a> via Humble Store.</p>
<p>I released all platforms on the same day, which was something I always wanted to try, and I have to say that it didn‚Äôt went as bad as I thought. As some of you know I have a day job so I had to take 2 vacation days to simple answer emails and do quick fixes, especially to the PC/Mac version. With each new software is natural to have problems at launch and Quest of Dungeons was no exception, and right now I‚Äôm still working on a daily basis in fixing some stuff and attending to some popular requests/changes from players to the game.</p>
<p>It was an extremely complicated task to do on my own, managing marketing, answering emails and tweets, scouting Steam forums to see if players are reporting problems, oh and do some actual coding, because you know, bugs don‚Äôt fix themselves. But overall I‚Äôm happy with the results so far.</p>
<p>The response to the game has been overall positive, and despite a few problems the game has gathered some good reviews.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22quest+of+dungeons%22">youtube videos</a>, and I even caught a few people live streaming it on Twitch, it‚Äôs always awesome to see people playing your game, and having genuine reactions.</p>
<p>This is one of my favourite moments (#spoilers)</p>
