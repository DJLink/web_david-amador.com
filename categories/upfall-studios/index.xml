      <description>First of all, Happy Birthday to Quest of Dungeons 7th anniversary, initially released on March 25th 2014 for PC and iOS. QoD eventually got several other versions and big content updates over time, and that‚Äôs all thanks to the support of the fans, making it possible for me to continue working on it, so thank you.
One thing I got asked frequently was about a physical release, and it took a bit of time but I‚Äôm happy to announce that, in cooperation with Leoful, it‚Äôs finally happening, and soon too, release date is April 13 and pre-orders are live (begin tomorrow, March 26).</description>

      <description>EDIT (09/09/2017):
Europe and America are now scheduled for a September 14 release date.
Hey,
So this will be a quick post, as news started appearing on twitter a couple moments ago and I wanted to answer some questions.
Super happy to say that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo Switch. Every since Nintendo announced the console that I‚Äôve been getting questions so this will make a lot of people happy, and the best thing is that it‚Äôs not far away.</description>

      <description>Exactly 3 years ago today, March 25th, Quest of Dungeons was released on Steam and iOS.
Feels unreal thinking what happened in these past three years, for those who remember I wasn‚Äôt even sure the game could make it to Steam, let alone end up being accepted by PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for their consoles.
A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Release date will be January 17th 2017!
Exciting news, Quest of Dungeons is on it‚Äôs way to PlayStation 4!!
It‚Äôs actually been in development for some time, and it‚Äôs very near completion, so it‚Äôs not going to be a huge wait until release hopefully.
The official QoD page on PlayStation went live just now so I decided it was a good time to let you know that this is happening, since I‚Äôve been getting questions about a PS4 version for some time.</description>

      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn‚Äôt had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I‚Äôve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>

      <description>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?
It‚Äôs been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it‚Äôs time to talk about what‚Äôs been happening in the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.
I‚Äôm working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I‚Äôm juggling between two ports on my own.</description>

      <description>Nintendo fans rejoice!!!
It‚Äôs time to reveal what I‚Äôve been up to lately, I‚Äôve been very cryptic on Twitter about what I was actually doing but it was for a good cause, because Quest of Dungeons is making it‚Äôs way on to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
Development started a couple months ago, so I still don‚Äôt have an ETA, but from now on I can be less vague to what I‚Äôm really doing.</description>

Quest of Dungeons was released on Xbox One exactly a month ago, and the response has been very positive from both players and reviewers, so I decided to list a couple review links here. There are several more, and tons of Youtube videos, so thank you all for helping spreading the word.

After months of development I‚Äôm very excited to finally be able say that it will be available on your console on that day.

      <description>I‚Äôve been talking about some of the new stuff here and then, but it‚Äôs time to show the Xbox version in more detail. A lot of the UI was remade to allow proper gamepad support, several bugs and tweaks were made, and even new features. Lets take a closer look.
In game First of all, here‚Äôs how it looks in game, a very minimalist UI if I might say so.</description>

      <description>Hi!
I‚Äôve been keeping this one a secret, but there‚Äôs going to a be a new class, a Necrodancer.
Yes you guessed it, it‚Äôs an homage to Cadence from the awesome game Crypt of the Necrodancer, you should buy it btw!
I‚Äôve been thinking about adding a new class for some time but never quite found anything interesting, each character, in my mind has it‚Äôs own personality and charisma and I was having a hard time finding any other interesting class.</description>

      <description>Quest of Dungeons is one year old, which means the first release was on March 25th 2014. I decided to leave you with some interesting stats collected over the whole year, it only counts Steam players , so it‚Äôs probably a bit more.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone, just a small update. GDC 2015 is happening right now and last night a trailer was released for Quest of Dungeons running on the Xbox One.
I made all new footage, running at 1080p in 60FPS for this new trailer, but kept more or less the structure of the original one since I think it reflects well what the game is all about.</description>

      <description>Last time we talked I was porting the engine to run on the actual Xbox One hardware, since them I managed to port the whole engine, it‚Äôs now running (not 100% stable), sound, rending, and input, all working. Since that part is a bit better now I decided to focus some time on new content, such as localization, the new dungeons and stuff that still doesn‚Äôt properly work with a controller.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been tweaking a lot of the gameplay to be suitable to use with a game controller and I‚Äôm starting to like the way it‚Äôs headed, it‚Äôs much more streamlined, faster and easy to use than the first attempt I made, some beta testing with a group of people helped with that.
Last week I started porting the engine to DirectX, yeah it‚Äôs that fun moment where nothing works, crashes everywhere.</description>

      <description>A new patch for iOS and Android went live, v1.1.1
There are some differences in what‚Äôs new for each one of the platforms, the biggest change being support for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on iOS and x86 architecture support on Android.
The reason why there are more tweaks on the iOS is because the Android version was updated more recently. After this update they are on par on features and fixes.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been doing a lot of menus and gamepad specifics related work lately.
My first step has been to make sure all menus are easy to use with a Xbox One controller, and while most of the menus in the main screen are usable, inside the game they are not.
Everything was made with mouse in mind at first so I decided to remake all of them again in a different way.</description>
