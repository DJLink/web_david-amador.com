      <description>First of all, Happy Birthday to Quest of Dungeons 7th anniversary, initially released on March 25th 2014 for PC and iOS. QoD eventually got several other versions and big content updates over time, and that‚Äôs all thanks to the support of the fans, making it possible for me to continue working on it, so thank you.
One thing I got asked frequently was about a physical release, and it took a bit of time but I‚Äôm happy to announce that, in cooperation with Leoful, it‚Äôs finally happening, and soon too, release date is April 13 and pre-orders are live (begin tomorrow, March 26).</description>

      <description>EDIT (09/09/2017):
Europe and America are now scheduled for a September 14 release date.
Hey,
So this will be a quick post, as news started appearing on twitter a couple moments ago and I wanted to answer some questions.
Super happy to say that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo Switch. Every since Nintendo announced the console that I‚Äôve been getting questions so this will make a lot of people happy, and the best thing is that it‚Äôs not far away.</description>

      <description>Exactly 3 years ago today, March 25th, Quest of Dungeons was released on Steam and iOS.
Feels unreal thinking what happened in these past three years, for those who remember I wasn‚Äôt even sure the game could make it to Steam, let alone end up being accepted by PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for their consoles.
A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs here, it finally happened! Quest of Dungeons is finally out for PlayStation 4 üòÄ

First of all, here are the links for the respective stores, you can also just search for the game and it should show on PSN Store.
US PSN Store: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/quest-of-dungeons/cid=UP1670-CUSA06182_00-QUESTDUNGEPS0001
EU PSN Store: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-gb/games/quest-of-dungeons/cid=EP1656-CUSA04830_00-QUESTDUNGEPS0001
Since I did this in the past, I decided to find a review video on Youtube that goes into detail about the game running on PS4, this should cover all things, so you can decide if this is a game that you might enjoy or not.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Release date will be January 17th 2017!
Exciting news, Quest of Dungeons is on it‚Äôs way to PlayStation 4!!
It‚Äôs actually been in development for some time, and it‚Äôs very near completion, so it‚Äôs not going to be a huge wait until release hopefully.
The official QoD page on PlayStation went live just now so I decided it was a good time to let you know that this is happening, since I‚Äôve been getting questions about a PS4 version for some time.</description>

      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn‚Äôt had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I‚Äôve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>

      <description>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?
It‚Äôs been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it‚Äôs time to talk about what‚Äôs been happening in the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.
I‚Äôm working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I‚Äôm juggling between two ports on my own.</description>

      <description>Nintendo fans rejoice!!!
It‚Äôs time to reveal what I‚Äôve been up to lately, I‚Äôve been very cryptic on Twitter about what I was actually doing but it was for a good cause, because Quest of Dungeons is making it‚Äôs way on to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
Development started a couple months ago, so I still don‚Äôt have an ETA, but from now on I can be less vague to what I‚Äôm really doing.</description>
