<p>It&rsquo;s around 11 a.m. as start to type this. 10 years ago at this hour, I was at my day job, trying to focus and not be distracted by the fact that later that day, at around 18h, <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com">Quest of Dungeons</a> was being released on Steam and iOS. For the first time, players around the world could try it. I was quite anxious about this; it had been a few years in the making, <a href="/2014/10/indie-dev-day-job-making-it-work-building-quest-of-dungeons/">mostly nights and weekends</a>. I had little idea of what to expect, but being on Steam was simultaneously exciting and terrifying. What if people hated it?</p>
<p>What follows for the rest of the post, is a brain dump of the timeline of some of the most crucial events of this silly little project for anyone who is curious.</p>

<p>‚úîÔ∏è Failing can help</p>
<p>Before the game launched, I had a few years of terrible prototypes, cancelled projects, and other unexpected life events. One day, though, all those mistakes fell into place, and QoD was born‚Äîa flow of ideas came to my mind, after seeing a bunch of stuff failed in front of me, but that maybe I could make them work. I knew what I wanted to avoid now and what I things I would like to experiment with. Within this time I also made a simple iOS game called <a href="/2012/09/puwang-a-5-day-work/">Puwang</a>, a gamejam compo, where most of the goal was to make a quick game and hopefully make $100 that year to cover the iOS developer account expenses. For QoD I wanted to make a small game that I could play on my phone during commute, and that&rsquo;s why it started as a mobile-only game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/qod_characters.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons characters"  />
</p>
<p>‚å®Ô∏è Expanding</p>
<p>During the time I was the only person to ever played it, I found myself enjoying it on a bigger screen/tablet, and after giving it a 2-3 friends to test and having confirmation, I thought it would be good to launch a desktop version along the iPhone/iPad versions, Windows and Mac.
This added some development time, but also allowed me to expand the game a bit more, the mobile version was virtually identical to desktop/tabled, but they shared a bigger UI, more suited for Mouse and the higher resolutions.
This turned out to be one of the best decisions, as the desktop version is foundation for everything after. At this point I was already <a href="/tags/basalt/">rolling my own engine</a> for prior games on mobile and desktop, so most of the development was indeed for game stuff, and not engine. While I&rsquo;ve made the mistake often of &ldquo;build the engine instead of game&rdquo;, here the engine was built around the game, that&rsquo;s how it should be.</p>
<h1 id="20140325---steam-and-ios-launch">2014/03/25 - Steam and iOS launch</h1>
<p>I had tried to bring games to Steam before but with no success. The focus was on Mobile, with Desktop in mind, but where to sell it? Before Steam I was able to get confirmation for the new Humble Store, but Steam was still on my mind. In the past I had higher hopes for my first game <a href="/tags/vizati/">Vizati</a>, looked more polished, so QoD didn&rsquo;t seemed to have a chance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screenshot-2022-11-01-at-19.38.50.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>But I decided to make a trailer and launch a GL page, and imagine my surprise when QoD was approved on Steam Greenlight within a week or so. Just look at my dumb face here that I just digged from some old Tweets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/david_amador_celebrating_qod_greenlight_2014-01-24_22.38.07.jpg" alt="David celebrating QoD approval on Steam Greenlight"  />
</p>
<p>With the trailer out, people seemed to enjoyed what they saw, I also thought I was near completing the game, there&rsquo;s always something right? So I pretty much crunched the entire rest of time between my day job and finishing the game.</p>
<p>Finally on March 25th it was out, everyone could play it. Since the game was only releasing around 18h on Steam, I went to my day job that day, and only took the next day off for checking &amp; fixing bugs etc.</p>
<p>Initially all I was getting was a flow of emails with some bugs and suggestions, but overall people seemed to like it, which was a relief. There was still tons of stuff to fix, but slowly, and for the next few weeks went through issues and suggestions. On the mobile side of things things were smoother, that version was the older one, had more testing, also less hardware configurations. I recall before launch, a conversation with some coworkers, that making it paid on mobile was probably a mistake, but I don&rsquo;t know how to design games around F2P/Ads, so I made it paid.  But, thankfully, even being a paid game, at $1.99, people were happy with what they were getting.</p>

</p>
<h1 id="20140530---linux">2014/05/30 - Linux</h1>
<p>This one was something that I had in the back on my mind for a while, theoretically my engine could be ported to Linux, but I was scared of having too many versions at launch, handing those 4 SKUs was already a handful, so this was left for later. This actually ended up being a factor in Humble Bundle contacting me to participate in one of their bundles, back then having a game on all 3 platforms was a must.
Technically speaking it wasn&rsquo;t extremely complicated, by this time the engine was already relatively split in ways that it was easy to integrate new OS, it was just a matter of implementation.
Also, now that Steam Deck is a thing, it just worked out of the box.</p>
<h1 id="20140826---android">2014/08/26 - Android</h1>
<p>With Desktops and iOS versions being well received I started getting requests for an Android version, I had never worked on this platform, but with most of the know bugs fixed, I bought a cheap Android phone and I moved into porting the game to this platform, you can read more about that <a href="/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/quest_of_dungeons_android_2014-05-29_00.05.50.jpg" alt="Quest of Dungeons Android"  />
</p>
<h1 id="2014---ouya-cancelled">2014 - OUYA (cancelled)</h1>
<p>The hot thing around the time was OUYA, games like TowerFall were born there, so since I had an Android version I started to work on that, because it would be the closest to a traditional console that I thought I could put this game on. I started working on it, but once Microsoft accepted my pitch for the Xbox One (see below), I placed this in low priority. Between the time it took me to develop the Xbox One version, OUYA had it downfall, and by that time I just cancelled it.</p>
<h1 id="201509---xbox-one">2015/09 - Xbox One</h1>
<p>In the summer of 2014, after the launch of all those versions, relatively successfully, I started talking with ID@Xbox with the possibility of bringing QoD to Xbox One. There were a couple months of paperwork and mostly the conversation about &ldquo;this is a mouse game, how will it work on consoles?&rdquo;, which was when I started seeing that all the UI needed to be remade, and even some gameplay.</p>
<p>There are several posts, <a href="/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/">here</a>, <a href="/2015/04/necrodancer-is-joining/">here</a>, <a href="/2014/11/qod-xo-devlog-1/">here</a>, <a href="/2015/01/qod-xo-devlog-2/">here</a> and <a href="/2015/02/qod-xo-devlog-3/">here</a>  detailing what went into to that process, but after around 1 year the game was finally released, and all the work put into reworking the game to controller friendly interface and gameplay paid off, it was <a href="/2015/10/quest-of-dungeons-reviews-roundup/">positively received</a>. I also took the opportunity to double the content available, and also add an <a href="/2015/04/necrodancer-is-joining/">extra character</a>. I&rsquo;m sure it was this combination of an almost remade version with increased content that led to it&rsquo;s positive feedback. I&rsquo;m really happy I decided to take all those months to remake it, it was daunting at first, I&rsquo;ll tell you that, but I&rsquo;m glad I did it.</p>

<h1 id="20160929---wii-u-and-nintendo-3ds">2016/09/29 - Wii U and Nintendo 3DS</h1>
<p>Around 2015 summer, before Xbox One release, and if I recall correctly, during Gamescom in Germany, I started talking with Nintendo about bringing the game to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.</p>
<p>This was when Nintendo was a bit more restrictive in terms of third party developers, and I was fully expecting, that me, a solo developer, would not make the cut, and it took a lot of months and patience to finally be able to show the game to someone and get accepted as an official Nintendo developer.</p>
<p>At first my goal was to make Wii U port first because it would be similar to Xbox One, with some additional features for the GamePad. Nintendo 3DS would come later, it would take more work due to it&rsquo;s specifics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending how you see it), I bricked my Wii U devKit after a couple months of work, when the game was in a good state already but before 100% finished. During the time I waited for repairs I started the Nintendo 3DS version.</p>
<p>I knew would take a LOT more work, from performance, to completely different UI for dual screen, hybrid of touch + buttons. But when the Wii U devKit arrived, I decided to launch them side-by-side, I talked with Nintendo about a cross-buy possibility, and once they gave the ok that was the goal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_new_inventory.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons StreetPass"  />
</p>
<p>The Nintendo 3DS version was one of the most complicated ones to pull off. This was also the first time that working on my own engine was the only thing making it possible. A lot of people were suggesting me to use Unity, and I had would have saved time in porting, which can be true, but Unity didn&rsquo;t supported 3DS, so it would never have happened if not for my custom framework.</p>
<p>This is hands down my favourite version, there is no other like it, mostly because of the nature of the device.</p>
<p>It was so fun to work with that I found myself <a href="/2016/05/qod-3dswii-u-port-devlog-1/">adding features</a> just because I wanted to test them, like the StreetPass, where you can get ghosts from other players you pass on the street. Nintendo had a really neat device here.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_qod_streetpass.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons StreetPass"  />
</p>
<p>There was some trouble having both versions on the same day, it&rsquo;s a lot of coordination required between me, Nintendo America and Europe teams, 4 different SKUs (3DS NA+EU, Wii U NA+EU), but in the end we made it.</p>
<p>Like I suspected during my own tests, on the 3DS it was the ideal portable version, it&rsquo;s a game that suits shorts sessions on the go.</p>
<p>This was also the first time I worked with a publisher for this game, for Japan, the game was published by Flyhigh Works, they took it to Tokyo Game Show, localized to JP, and were crucial in shaping up the 3DS version into what it is. I do recall many sessions where my stubbornness almost caused some bad decisions in the game, but they were really cool in guiding me to make the best of it.</p>

<h1 id="20170120---playstation-4-and-the-vita-version-that-never-was">2017/01/20 - PlayStation 4 and the Vita version that never was.</h1>
<p>I love my PlayStation 4, in fact it&rsquo;s the console I have more physical games for.</p>
<p>So it was with great excitement that after a Skype call with my PlayStation rep I had the greenlight to get the game there. This started around the time of Nintendo too, but sadly, and at first I wanted PS4 + Vita combo, like Wii U + 3DS, but for a variety of reasons the PlayStation Vita never happened.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons the PS4 versions was one of the latter ones, I kept hoping I could launch both simultaneously but never happened. Fun fact, this version almost had a physical edition that got cancelled by the publisher at last moment, eventually I even got someone, another publisher, to take care of the PS Vita version, but that also got cancelled later on. So a combination of things that happened that were no one&rsquo;s fault, but also made it a bit hard for me to explain why it wasn&rsquo;t happening. In certain moments it was almost, but it never did happened. It was a bit frustrating that I didn&rsquo;t had clear answers for the players regarding this, but I couldn&rsquo;t, and I tried but failed in the end. Well, that&rsquo;s game development.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qod_ps4_no_name.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons on PlayStation 4"  />
</p>
<h1 id="20170810---nintendo-switch">2017/08/10 - Nintendo Switch</h1>
<p>Around 1 month after I released on Wii U and 3DS, Nintendo announced their new hybrid console, the Nintendo Switch. I immediately started getting questions from players about a port. This complicated promoting the new Nintendo versions while everyone was excited about the upcoming console, saving money for it and the games. By coincidence I had launched both versions right at the end.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall exactly when conversations started with Nintendo about this, since it was in hot demand, both for retail and developers, but eventually Nintendo shipped me a devKit and I started porting. It was released first in the Japanese regions, again by Flyhigh Works. But a few weeks later again by me in the rest of the world. This version had the portability of 3DS, and graphics/resolution and UI of the home consoles. This was also the first time I made a demo for the game, which still exists on the eShop.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/quest_of_dungeons_switch.jpg" alt="Quest of Dungeons on Nintendo Switch"  />
</p>
<h1 id="2019---dreamcast-just-having-fun">2019 - Dreamcast (just having fun)</h1>
<p>In 2019 I got my hands on a Dreamcast I decided to &ldquo;wonder if I can port it there?&rdquo;, it was never really meant for a full release, that would take months of time that I don&rsquo;t have at the moment,
I just posting it here for the record, this was under a week of work, it was fun. Maybe if I reach retirement I&rsquo;ll take some time to finish it. There&rsquo;s a lot of work left in there.</p>
<p>After a while booting the game on an emulator,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/qod_dreamcast_2.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons running on emulator 1"  />
</p>
<p>and then later when I got it booting on a real Dreamcast</p>

<h1 id="20210413---switch-physical-edition">2021/04/13 - Switch Physical Edition</h1>
<p>Like I mentioned before, I tried to get the game in physical format before, and I kept trying for years but it simply wasn&rsquo;t happening. Until 2021, when by random chance, someone recommended me Leoful, and they accepted right away, in fact, from initial contact to production, it was just a couple months, I&rsquo;m really happy I was able to finally get the game on an actual box, it hits differently, as I <a href="/2010/08/games-and-systems-from-childhood/">grew playing Nintendo games</a>,  and also feels like a closure to a project that started on a smaller device and made it&rsquo;s way to a real physical game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Quest-of-Dungeons-Nintendo-Switch-Physical-edition.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons Physical Edition for Nintendo Switch"  />
</p>
<h1 id="2022---">2022 - ??</h1>
<p>Right now the game still exists in several stores (R.I.P. Nintendo 3DS and Wii U), and it&rsquo;s in maintenance mode only. The platforms patched more regularly are the mobile ones, whenever Apple or Android come up with new rules or it breaks on new devices. Windows gives nearly no problems, MacOS breaks things more often, but overall it doesn&rsquo;t give a lot of work, the last time I had to mess with it, was the Linux version to patch stuff for Steam Deck, but it was relatively easy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/quest_of_dungeons_steam_deck.jpg" alt="Quest of Dungeons on Steam Deck"  />
</p>
<p>So in the end things worked out, and I want to say a big thank you to everyone who supported this project, I read all the emails, DMs, messages everyone sent over the years, even fanart, you rock.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gKx4R.gif" alt=""  />
</p>
<h1 id="some-trivia">Some trivia</h1>
<ul>
<li>The game has 79k of code (all platforms)</li>
<li>The game engine has 130k of code (all platforms)</li>
<li>Over 63800 years of total play time on Steam alone</li>
<li>The game allowing the player to drop items anywhere and being persistent was a side effect of saving the whole world to save instead of recreating it by seed. I just turned it into a feature.</li>
<li>I was only able to finish the game in Hell mode AFTER releasing it, the math seemed to check out, but I wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</li>
<li>The game was called Quest of Dungeons from day 1 of development, as a generic codename, I just grew too attached to it.</li>
<li>There was a pet system that got dropped, taming enemies, but it was dropped in favour of Shaman unique skill of summons.</li>
<li>There was a way for enemies to travel between floors, like Resident Evil added that later on, going between rooms, but it was too aggressive and made the game frustratingly hard.</li>
<li>All the level and combat damage math falls apart around character level 40 or above, but the game was designed below that.</li>
<li>The initial skull sign, which only exists at the very start, was a way to teach the player that death meant restarting, in 2013-14 roguelikes weren&rsquo;t as popular and it was seen as a shock for that to happen (play-testers would email me &ldquo;my save is lost&rdquo;). My goal was that by potentially learning that early on, the player would not get surprised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading all of this.</p>

      <description>EDIT (09/09/2017):
Europe and America are now scheduled for a September 14 release date.
Hey,
So this will be a quick post, as news started appearing on twitter a couple moments ago and I wanted to answer some questions.
Super happy to say that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo Switch. Every since Nintendo announced the console that I‚Äôve been getting questions so this will make a lot of people happy, and the best thing is that it‚Äôs not far away.</description>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>So this will be a quick post, as news started appearing on twitter a couple moments ago and I wanted to answer some questions.</p>
<p>Super happy to say that <strong>Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo Switch</strong>. Every since Nintendo announced the console that I‚Äôve been getting questions so this will make a lot of people happy, and the best thing is that it‚Äôs not far away. In <strong>Japan is already releasing next week, August 10</strong>, <a href="http://flyhighworks.heteml.jp/games/">Flyhigh Works</a> is handing publishing in the Japanese territory.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be taking care of the rest of the world, but for <strong>Europe and America I‚Äôm still working on it</strong>, but hopefully it won‚Äôt take much more time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a sneak peek at the new logo and the new main animation made by <a href="https://twitter.com/rephildesign">@rephildesign</a></p>

</p>
<p>I already got a couple questions asked via twitter so I‚Äôll try to put here the most frequent ones.</p>
<p>F.A.Q. / tl;dr</p>
<p><strong>-Release date?</strong><br>
In Japan the game will be releasing in August 10. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NA/EU dev still under way, I‚Äôll update this when there are changes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It will be released on September 14 in Europe, America and Australia.</p>
<p><strong>-How much?</strong><br>
Same as the Wii U/Nintendo 3DS, $8.99</p>
<p><strong>-New features?</strong><br>
Yes there are some new things, there‚Äôs a new Mansion, so you have a couple more different themes and sprites. Also a new Feats system to track Achievements, there are several other optimizations/tweaks/changes, but those are the main changes.</p>
<p><strong>-Who ported the game?</strong><br>
Port was made in-house. Flyhigh Works is publishing in Japan, Upfall Studios will be doing the publishing on rest of the world.</p>

      <title>Quest of Dungeons turns 3 years old, a small message for the community</title>

      <description>Exactly 3 years ago today, March 25th, Quest of Dungeons was released on Steam and iOS.
Feels unreal thinking what happened in these past three years, for those who remember I wasn‚Äôt even sure the game could make it to Steam, let alone end up being accepted by PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for their consoles.
A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.</description>

<p>Feels unreal thinking what happened in these past three years, for those who remember I wasn‚Äôt even sure the game could make it to Steam, let alone end up being accepted by PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for their consoles.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DJ_Link/status/419147399375118336"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screenshot-2022-11-01-at-19.38.50.png" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this chance to say thank you to everyone who purchased the game, who helped by making Youtube videos, streaming, recommending to friends, and all the support. If I was able to convince anyone to accept the game on their console/platform it was because the players were talking about it, purchasing and saying they cared. So while I may have built the game, without the community this wouldn‚Äôt have happen, I couldn‚Äôt have done this without you.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gKx4R.gif" alt="Hugs"  />
</p>
<p><strong>What now?</strong><br>
Many of you have been asking if I‚Äôm working on something new, and the answer is yes, but it‚Äôs still a bit soon to discuss what it is, I‚Äôll share more details at a later time. But I‚Äôm excited (although a bit nervous) to start working on something new after 4 years of dev in the same project.</p>
<p><strong>What about QoD now?</strong><br>
Although I‚Äôm moving to new projects that doesn‚Äôt mean work on QoD is completely halting. I intend to keep fixing issues with new devices/OS, this is particularly true with mobile devices which rapidly evolve. I don‚Äôt have immediate plans for new content (another popular question), but again, might happen if something makes sense to add in order to improve the game.<br>
As of recently a common question is ‚ÄúQuest of Dungeons on Switch when?‚Äù, and while I would love to have the game there, especially with Wii U fading out, and because the game fits well on a portable mode, the ultimate decision to have the game there is up to Nintendo. All I can say about this is that I‚Äôll talk with them and will inform you of any changes.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs it for now, thank you for reading. As always feel free reach me via twitter, email, etc. Until the next update.<br>
-David</p>

PS4 dashboard showing Question of Dungeons
First of all, here are the links for the respective stores, you can also just search for the game and it should show on PSN Store.

Exciting news, Quest of Dungeons is on it‚Äôs way to PlayStation 4!!
It‚Äôs actually been in development for some time, and it‚Äôs very near completion, so it‚Äôs not going to be a huge wait until release hopefully.
The official QoD page on PlayStation went live just now so I decided it was a good time to let you know that this is happening, since I‚Äôve been getting questions about a PS4 version for some time.</description>

      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn‚Äôt had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I‚Äôve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>

<p><em><strong>-Does it have off-TV support?</strong></em><br>
Yes, you can play with the GamePad only.</p>
<p><em><strong>-Does it support Wii U Pro Controller?</strong></em><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><em><strong>-What does the GamePad screen shows?</strong></em><br>
There are 3 different ways you can play the game</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-TV mode: You can play the game just on the GamePad.</li>
<li>TV-Only: In this mode everything is on the TV, just like the PC version, and you can play with either Wii U Pro Controller or GamePad</li>
<li>Mixed: GamePad shows a Minimap and touch Inventory (video below)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this covers most ways people enjoy using when playing on their Wii U.</p>
<p><em><strong>-How much?</strong></em><br>
Game will be sold at $8.99/‚Ç¨8.99/¬£7.99. I made the game cross-buy so you get the Nintendo 3DS version for free if you have the same NNID on both systems. See below for Nintendo 3DS version release.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-the-nintendo-3ds-version"><strong>So what about the Nintendo 3DS version?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="/2016/09/quest-of-dungeons-coming-to-nintendo-3ds-on-september-29/">Nintendo 3DS version will be released on September 29 as well.</a><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still don‚Äôt have a locked release date, next time I talk about it, it will be to announce when. Coordinating both versions of the game (on both regions) for a simultaneous release turned out to be a bit trickier than anticipated to the small team (1 person), I‚Äôm working on some last minute issues, and I‚Äôll try to release it close as possible to the Wii U version. When I have the final release date I‚Äôll let you know. It will be launched simultaneously on both regions as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="cross-buy"><strong>Cross-buy</strong></h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, the game will have cross-buy, so if you buy the Wii U version on September 29, when the Nintendo 3DS version gets released you will get it for free if you use the same NNID. So don‚Äôt feel shy to buy it, because you won‚Äôt have to choose one or another version.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions and spread the word.</p>

      <description>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?
It‚Äôs been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it‚Äôs time to talk about what‚Äôs been happening in the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.
I‚Äôm working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I‚Äôm juggling between two ports on my own.</description>

<p>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons <a href="/2016/02/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u/"> for 3DS and Wii U</a>, so it‚Äôs time to talk about what‚Äôs been happening in the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I‚Äôm juggling between two ports on my own.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, both are already up and running, graphics, sound, input, all of that is working (as far as I tested anyway. bugs yikes).</p>
<p>I had to greatly optimize some portions of the code for the 3DS version, because I want to try to target 60FPS, let‚Äôs see if I can accomplish that.</p>
<p>Wii U is obviously a more powerful machine so the pre-existing game code from the Xbox version, after I ported it to the Wii U, just ran.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if the game is running, what is left?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm doing specific features for both versions, and that takes time. Both consoles have a second touch screen for example, so I had to come up with a feasible way to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Wii U</strong></p>
<p>On Wii U you can play the traditional way, TV, but I also added off-tv support, so you can play just on the GamePad screen. I have Pro Controller support and another way you can play is a mix between TV and gamepad screen, where you can use a touch based inventory, map, etc to manage things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can even play with the Pro Controller, and watch the game on the gamepad screen, as a tiny TV. I spent the last few weeks adding these changes which I hope will prove useful for players.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line is:</strong> Yes, you can play only with buttons, like a ‚Äúregular‚Äù game, but if you want, there is some gamepad use, but it‚Äôs optional.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo 3DS</strong></p>
<p>The 3DS version is proving to be the most challenging one, first there were some technical issues I had to overcome, now is trying to fit all content in both those screens in a coherent way. If you played the other versions you know there is a fair amount of menus/UI at the user disposal, either to check inventory, character equipment, skills, buffs, quests, stats, etc.</p>
<p><em>UI/Dual Screen</em></p>
<p>I started by doing a 2 screen split-inventory, imagine the Xbox One but kind of split between 2 screens. So the list was on the top screen, and the item description on the bottom one. And that worked.</p>
<p><em>OLD</em></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_old_inventory.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_old_inventory.png" alt="qod_3ds_old_inventory"  />
</a></p>
<p>However I was never 100% happy with it, and I was barely using touch, which despite not being a personal favorite, I know I lot of people like, so I decided to throw all away and redo it differently. In a way that players could either touch items to open description (the second screen on the previous version) and then Eat/Equip/etc, but also that with a button press you can use it too, via dpad and a/b/x/y.</p>
<p>This is posing some challenges since I‚Äôm now trying to put everything that was on 2 screens into a single one, but I‚Äôll get there.<br>
This is still WIP but I feel I‚Äôm getting near something a bit better.</p>
<p><em>NEW (WIP)</em></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_new_inventory.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_new_inventory.png" alt="qod_3ds_new_inventory"  />
</a></p>
<p><em>StreetPass</em></p>
<p>I never considered using StreetPass, but the other day I woke up with a cool idea. When you StreetPass someone you send and receive ghosts from previous runs to the other user. Here‚Äôs how it works, when you die, the game saves your character as it is, stats, equipment, etc. There is later a chance, that in a new game you might encounter yourself, but now you will also send those ghosts to the other players. So when you find ghosts from other users (they will have a icon in-game to make it different) if you defeat them, you‚Äôll get all the loot. Cool right?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_qod_streetpass.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_qod_streetpass.png" alt="3ds_qod_streetpass"  />
</a></p>
<p>Final reminder, everything discussed here is WIP so it can change.<br>
So still no ETA, but I‚Äôm getting closer. And that is it for now. I‚Äôll let you guys know when I have more news.</p>

      <description>Nintendo fans rejoice!!!
It‚Äôs time to reveal what I‚Äôve been up to lately, I‚Äôve been very cryptic on Twitter about what I was actually doing but it was for a good cause, because Quest of Dungeons is making it‚Äôs way on to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
Development started a couple months ago, so I still don‚Äôt have an ETA, but from now on I can be less vague to what I‚Äôm really doing.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
Quest of Dungeons was released on Xbox One exactly a month ago, and the response has been very positive from both players and reviewers, so I decided to list a couple review links here. There are several more, and tons of Youtube videos, so thank you all for helping spreading the word.
