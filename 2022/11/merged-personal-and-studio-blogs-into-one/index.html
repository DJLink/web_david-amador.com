It felt like the audiences were in other places so it made more sense.

I think the new rules of websites requiring the “must gather followers” for helping reach more people has conditioned me a lot, and usually is the thing that I (and probably more people) look into when evaluating any social website, the growth potential. But it doesn’t always have to be about that, and blogs have served me well in the past to talk about something or pass a message.\nIn terms of work related stuff I’ll do a more detailed post eventually, but I’ve been very busy with contract work, since a while before the pandemic started in March 2020, I’ve been working in porting games to consoles, Unity and GameMaker 2, it has been a very interesting learning experience. I really like coding my own frameworks (heck this whole blog is mostly about that kind stuff), but it has been interesting to code on other engines, take inspiration, see tools that work in new modern paradigms, tech moves so fast that it’s easy to stand still, and using these tools has re-think a lot of things, that I would probably approach different the next time I decide to “code from scratch”.\nUnity has made me go back again to C#, which was my main language during XNA time (how I miss it), and after a few years of C++ I sort of missed some of it’s things, that C++ still complicates often, even if it’s better these days.\nWell that’s it for now, this ran a bit longer than I anticipated, I just wanted to update on the blog merge, for any possible visitors. If you are still around thank you so much, I’ll see you next time.\nPS: I have no idea if the comment section still works, I should test it myself to see if it does.
