I’d rather risk elsewhere.\nWhat next? For the past couple days I’ve trying to decide on exactly where, but haven’t made my mind yet. But I have decided that I’ll at least try to wrap up the prototype phase in Unity, makes sense, game is still a bit barebones (why I’m not talking about it yet) but there’s a lot done, so I’d rather pass the whole “toy prototyping messy code” in Unity, and when it feels time to move to production port the whole thing elsewhere and in the process hopefully have a cleaner code base.\nCustom or another engine I’m unsure, but atm I’m leaning more towards custom, but that would mean I’d probably either reshape my entire custom engine, or do from scratch, reason being, it’s 100% object oriented, and while working with Unity I discovered there’s tons of advantages to the Entity Component System, so I want that on my framework.

As for my next game, progress has been slow, because I’m still taking the approach of contract work, and working on it on my spare time until it feels like a viable project and deciding full or part-time.\nAfter working on Quest of Dungeons for many years (which I’m grateful) I did several prototypes that were, to be honest, not good games, and I will never ship something that at the very least I don’t find fun, so yeah sorry it’s been a while.
