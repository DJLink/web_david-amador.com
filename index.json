[{"content":"üìù It\u0026rsquo;s been 10 years It\u0026rsquo;s around 11 a.m. as start to type this. 10 years ago at this hour, I was at my day job, trying to focus and not be distracted by the fact that later that day, at around 18h, Quest of Dungeons was being released on Steam and iOS. For the first time, players around the world could try it. I was quite anxious about this; it was a few years in the making, mostly nights and weekends. I had little idea of what to expect, but being on Steam was simultaneously exciting and terrifying. What if people hate it?\nWhat follows for the rest of the post, is a brain dump of the timeline of some of the most crucial events of this silly little project for anyone who is curious.\nü§Ø 2011-2013 ‚úîÔ∏è Failing can help\nBefore the game launched, I had a few years of terrible prototypes, cancelled projects, and other unexpected life events. One day, though, all those mistakes fell into place, and QoD was born‚Äîa flow of ideas came to my mind after seeing a bunch of stuff failed in front of me, but that I could maybe make them work. I knew what things I wanted to avoid now and what I would like to experiment with. In this time I also made a simple iOS game called Puwang, most of the goal was to make a quick game and hopefully make $100 that year to cover iOS developer account expenses, once that was covered, for QoD I wanted to make a small game that I could play on my phone during commute, and that\u0026rsquo;s why it started as a mobile-only game.\n‚å®Ô∏è Expanding\nDuring the time I was the only person to ever played it, I found myself liking to play it on a bigger screen/tablet, and after giving it a 2-3 friends to test and having confirmation, I thought to launch a desktop version along the iPhone/iPad versions. This added some development time, but also allowed me to expand the game a bit more, the mobile version was virtually identical to desktop, but desktop/tablet shared a bigger UI, more suited for Mouse. This turned out to be one of the best decisions, as the desktop version made the foundation for everything after. At this point I was already rolling my own engine for prior games on mobile and desktop, so most of the development was indeed for game stuff, and not engine.\n2014/03/25 - Steam and iOS launch I had tried to bring games to Steam before but with no success. The focus was on Mobile, with Desktop in mind, but where to put it? I had higher hopes for a previous game Vizati, looked more polished, so QoD didn\u0026rsquo;t seemed to have a chance\nBut I decided to make a trailer and launch a GL page, and imagine my surprise when QoD was approved on Steam Greenlight within a week or so. Just look at my dumb face here that I just digged from some old Tweets.\nWith the trailer out, people seemed to enjoyed what they were watching, and while I thought I was near finishing the game, there\u0026rsquo;s always something right? So I pretty much crunched the entire rest of time between my day job and finishing the game.\nFinally on March 25th it was out, everyone could play it. Since the game was only releasing around 18h on Steam, I went to my day job that day, and only took the next day off for checking \u0026amp; fixing bugs etc.\nInitially all I was getting was a flow of emails with some bugs and suggestions, but overall people seemed to like it, which was a relief. There was still tons of stuff to fix, but I slowly, and for the next few weeks went through the issues and suggestions. On the mobile side of things things were smoother, mostly because that version was the older one, had way more testing, also less hardware configurations. To my surprise, even being a paid game, not F2P, at $1.99, people were happy with what they were getting.\n2014/05/30 - Linux This one was something that I had in the back on my mind for a while, theoretically my engine could be ported to Linux, but I was scared of having too many versions at launch, handing those 4 SKUs was already a handful, so this was left for a bit later. This actually ended up being a factor in Humble Bundle contacting me to participate in one of their bundles, back then having a game on all 3 platforms was a must. Technically speaking it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much complicated, but by this time the engine was already relatively split in ways that it was easy to integrate new OS, it was just a matter of implementation. Also, now that Steam Deck is a thing, it just worked out of the box.\n2014/08/26 - Android With Desktops and iOS versions being well received I started getting requests for an Android version, I had never worked on this platform, but with most of the know bugs fixed I moved into porting the game to Android, you can read more about that here.\n2014 - OUYA (cancelled) After the Android version, the hot thing was OUYA, games like TowerFall were born there, so since I had an Android version I started to work on that, mostly because it would be the closest to a traditional console that I thought I could put this game on. I started some work on it, but once Microsoft accepted my pitch for the Xbox One (see below), I placed this in low priority. Between the time it took me to develop the Xbox One version, OUYA had it downfall, and by that time I just cancelled it.\n2015/09 - Xbox One In the summer of 2014, after the launch of all those versions, relatively successfully, I started talking with ID@Xbox with the possibility of bringing QoD to Xbox One. There were a couple months of paperwork and mostly the conversation about \u0026ldquo;this is a mouse game, how will it work on consoles?\u0026rdquo;, which was when I started seeing that all the UI needed to be remade, and even some gameplay. There are several posts, here, here, here, here and here detailing what went into to that process, but after around 1 year the game was finally released, and all the work put into reworking the game to controller friendly interface and gameplay paid off, it was positively received. I also took the opportunity to double the content available, and also add an extra character. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it was this combination of an almost remade version with increased content that led to it\u0026rsquo;s positive feedback. I\u0026rsquo;m really happy I decided to take all those months to remake it, it was daunting at first, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you that, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did it.\n2016 - Wii U and Nintendo 3DS Around 2015 summer, even before Xbox One release, if I recall correctly during Gamescom in Germany, I started talking with Nintendo about bringing the game to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. This was when Nintendo was a bit more restrictive in terms of third party developers, and I was fully expecting, that me, a solo developer, would not make the cut, and it took a lot of months and patience to finally be able to show the game to someone and get accepted as an official Nintendo developer.\nAt first my goal was to make Wii U first because it would be similar to Xbox One, with some additional features for the GamePad. Nintendo 3DS would come later, it would take more work due to it\u0026rsquo;s specifics.\nUnfortunately, or fortunately (depending how you see it), I bricked my Wii U devKit after a couple months of work, so when the game was in a good state already but before 100% finished. During the I waited for repairs I started working on the Nintendo 3DS version.\nI knew would take a LOT more work, from performance, to completely different UI for dual screen, hybrid of touch + buttons. But when the Wii U devKit arrived, I decided to launch them side-by-side, I talked with Nintendo about a cross-buy possibility, and once they gave the ok that was the goal.\nThe Nintendo 3DS version was one of the most complicated ones to pull off. This was also the first time that working on my own engine made it seem worth it. A lot of people were suggesting me to use Unity, and I had saved some time in porting, but Unity didn\u0026rsquo;t supported 3DS, it would never have happened if not for my custom framework. Honestly this is my favourite versions, there is no other like it, mostly because of the nature of the device.\nIt was so fun to work with that I found myself adding features just because I wanted to test them, like the StreetPass, where you can get ghosts from other players you pass on the street. Nintendo had a really neat device here.\nThere was some trouble having both versions on the same day, because it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of coordination required between me, Nintendo America and Europe teams, 4 different SKUs (3DS NA+EU, Wii U NA+EU), but in the end we made it.\nLike I suspected during my own tests, on the 3DS it was the ideal portable version, it\u0026rsquo;s a game that suits shorts sessions on the go.\nThis was also the first time I worked with a publisher for this game, for Japan, the game was published by Flyhigh Works, they took it to Tokyo Game Show, localized to JP, and were crucial in shaping up the 3DS version into what it is. I do recall many sessions where my stubbornness almost caused some bad decisions in the game, but they were really cool in guiding me to make the best of it.\n2017/01/20 - PlayStation 4 and the Vita version that never was. I love my PlayStation 4, in fact it\u0026rsquo;s the console I have more physical games for.\nSo it was with great excitement that after a Skype call with my PlayStation rep I had the greenlight to get the game there. This started around the time of Nintendo too, but sadly, and at first I wanted PS4 + Vita combo, like Wii U + 3DS, but for a variety of reasons the PlayStation Vita never happened.\nThis was one of the reasons the PS4 versions was one of the latter ones, I kept hoping I could launch both simultaneously but never happened. Fun fact, this version almost had a physical edition that got cancelled by the publisher at last moment, eventually I even got someone, another publisher, to take care of the PS Vita version, but that also got cancelled later on. So a combination of things that happened that were no one\u0026rsquo;s fault, but also made it a bit hard for me to explain why it wasn\u0026rsquo;t happening. In certain moments it was almost, but it never did happened. It was a bit frustrating that I didn\u0026rsquo;t had clear answers for the players regarding this, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t, and I tried but failed in the end. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s game development.\n2017/09/14 - Nintendo Switch 2-3 months after I released on Wii U and 3DS, Nintendo announced their new hybrid console, the Nintendo Switch. I immediately started getting questions from players about a port. This complicated promoting the new Nintendo versions while everyone was excited about the upcoming console, saving money for it and the games.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t recall exactly when conversations started with Nintendo about this, it was in hot demand, in retail and developers, but eventually they shipped me a devKit and I started porting. It was released first in the Japanese regions, by Flyhigh Works. But a few weeks later again by me in the rest of the world. This version had the portability of 3DS, and graphics/resolution and UI of the home consoles. One of the most unique versions available.\n2019 - Dreamcast (just having fun, not for releasing) In 2019 I got my hands on a Dreamcast I decided to \u0026ldquo;wonder if I can port it there?\u0026rdquo;, it was never really meant for a full release, that would take months of time that I don\u0026rsquo;t have at the moment, I just posting it here for the record, this was under a week of work, it was fun. Maybe if I reach retirement I\u0026rsquo;ll take some time to finish it. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work left in there.\nAfter a while booting the game on an emulator,\nand then later when I got it booting on a real Dreamcast\nYour browser does not support the video tag. 2021/04/13 - Switch Physical Edition Like I mentioned before, I tried to get the game in physical format before, and I kept trying for years but it simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t happening. Until 2021, when by random chance, someone recommended me Leoful, and they accepted right away, in fact, from initial contact to production, it was just a couple months, I\u0026rsquo;m really happy I was able to finally get the game on an actual box, it hits differently, as I grew playing Nintendo games, and also feels like a closure to a project that started on a smaller device and made it\u0026rsquo;s way to a real physical game.\n2022 - ?? Right now the game still exists in several stores (R.I.P. Nintendo 3DS and Wii U), the versions patched more regularly are the mobile ones, when Apple or Android come up with some new rules or it breaks on new devices. It\u0026rsquo;s in maintenance mode only. Desktop doesn\u0026rsquo;t give a lot of work, the last time I had to mess around with it, was the Linux version to patch stuff for Steam Deck, but it was relatively easy.\nSo in the end things worked out, and I want to say a big thank you to everyone who supported this project, I read all the emails, DMs, messages everyone sent over the years, even fanart, you rock.\nSome trivia The game has 79k of code (all platforms) The game engine has 130k of code (all platforms) Over 63800 years of total play time on Steam alone The game allowing the player to drop items anywhere and being persistent was a side effect of saving the whole world to save instead of recreating it by seed. I just turned it into a feature. I was only able to finish the game in Hell mode AFTER releasing it, the math seemed to check out, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t good enough. The game was called Quest of Dungeons from day 1 of development, as a generic codename, I just grew too attached to it. There was a pet system that got dropped, taming enemies, but it was dropped in favour of Shaman unique skill of summons. There was a way for enemies to travel between floors, like Resident Evil added that later on, going between rooms, but it was too aggressive and made the game frustratingly hard. All the level and combat damage math falls apart around character level 40 or above, but the game was designed below that. The initial skull sign, which only exists at the very start, was a way to teach the player that death meant restarting, in 2013-14 roguelikes weren\u0026rsquo;t as popular and it was seen as a shock for that to happen (play-testers would email me \u0026ldquo;my save is lost\u0026rdquo;). My goal was that by potentially learning that early on, the player would not get surprised. Thank you for reading all of this.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a cool image made by Leonor.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2024/03/quest-of-dungeons-turns-10-years-old/","summary":"üìù It\u0026rsquo;s been 10 years It\u0026rsquo;s around 11 a.m. as start to type this. 10 years ago at this hour, I was at my day job, trying to focus and not be distracted by the fact that later that day, at around 18h, Quest of Dungeons was being released on Steam and iOS.

I\u0026rsquo;ve moved everything to static content, including this website.\nüìù WordPress Since the very beginning (~2008) this blog has been powered by WordPress, it served me well, it worked, had a nice backend to make the posts, plugins and themes. After a couple years I moved from shared hosting to a VPS, I had other websites and services I needed running and all in same machine was better and cheaper. But WordPress needs a lot of things, PHP, MySQL, maintenance in all those moving parts.\nSo for the past couple of years I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking in migrating it to something like Jekyll or Hugo, to serve it as static content. But the few times I looked into the process it seemed like a big task especially because I have 184 posts, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just starting from 0, I wanted to maintain the existing content, posts, images, URLs etc. So, a couple days ago I decided it was time.\nüìù Converting and Moving the websites üîó questofdungeons.com This was the easier of them, it\u0026rsquo;s just not working 100% as it was before (more on that in a bit). Site was just a couple of hand-made pages I hacked in HTML/CSS/JS years ago, so that was already done.\nThe only problem was the stats page relied on a PHP script to pull the stats from Steam. PHP was out of the question since I wanted to host on GitHub, so I tried the full JavaScript approach, but that hits the CORS issue, and I would need a proxy for that, so for now I grabbed the last stats and it\u0026rsquo;s serving it statically. I have to think of something else later since I don\u0026rsquo;t have PHP anymore etc. But it\u0026rsquo;s not important and the numbers aren\u0026rsquo;t moving as much as they used to. I grabbed all files, pushed to a GitHub repo, activated pages, changed the nameservers, queued SSL cert, and voil√°, the site is now live.\nüîó upfallStudios.com The merging the Upfall Studios blog a while ago was not an isolated act, I was thinking about this already. After the merge, www.upfallstudios.com was left with only the front page, which was static content already. I also had a doPresskit() page, which was all PHP, and I need to keep it for games info etc. After a bit of search I found there is an alternative, serving static content, so I converted and updated the site to use it, that way 100% of the site was ready. Easy and working as before.\nüîó david-amador.com And now I was free to focus on the one I knew would be a headache, this blog. Full wordpress site, no static content, everything dynamic using plugins, MySQL, PHP and custom .htaccess rules.\n‚ùå Jekyll From prior research, I was inclined to Jekyll since all I read online was that it was good, also it\u0026rsquo;s been around for 15 years, so it has proved it works and should be stable. But after a couple days of messing around with configs and pre-requisites, packages versions mismatches between Jekyll, ruby, wordpress exporters etc, I gave up. Booting up a new site can be achieved fast, but I needed to also be able to import all of my content, and that proved to be hard. Also I started thinking about the future of the blog, what if in a couple years the version breaks on modern OS version, and I can\u0026rsquo;t run the latest one due to some incompatibility, even on a VM that would be a nightmare to keep around just for one site.\n‚úÖ Hugo So I decided to go for Hugo, single executable, it works, it\u0026rsquo;s fast. Highly recommend it. The documentation does lacks sometimes, but between the forums, and looking at other people\u0026rsquo;s pages on GitHub it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly doable.\nI had to export the data, and there are a couple of Wordpress plugins for that, the problem was that my server was old, i386, outdated Ubuntu version, the PHP server version had no Zip support, which most of those plugins needed. After messing around a bit with the server trying to install the proper dependencies, which included actually breaking the entire thing and having to restore from backup, I decided a different approached. Created a Docker VM with wordpress, imported my existing WP files and database locally, installed the required plugins and was finally able to export all.\nüìÑ Now that I had all the files in markdown format, it was really more of a going through Hugo documentation, placing all freshly made files in place and cleaning up stuff. One neat thing is that you can run and edit an Hugo website live.\nHugo.exe server -D This will make the site run on localhost:1313/ , so while you edit the markdown files, it will keep refreshing, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even had to press F5, I could have it side by side and Ctrl+S, super fast to iterate.\nüé• There was a LOT of YouTube embed code, that I placed over the years, and was not ever working anymore on original website, some of it had Macromedia code, yeah, that old! So I tried to fix all that, then just regex replace some stuff like wrong image paths.\nüßë‚Äçüíª I also had to fix some of the programming code block notation. I was using\n\u0026lt;pre lang=\u0026#34;LANG\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; for code blocks, but the parser collapsed in a couple posts, leaving pre tags, which was helpful in searching for them actually. I fixed all I could find.\nüó£Ô∏è As for the comments, I had Disqus installed on Upfall Studios blog, but on this blog it was on WP system, so what I did was just import all the comments on Disqus and merged both. So the comment system should work on the bottom of all posts (say Hi if you want :)\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if all the comments are there though, one particular post I had to go back and import it manually again, but it also had over 100 comments, so it might have failed the first time. I still have all the old data, so if needed (and I can spot it) I can always import it again on Disqus.\nüì∞ The RSS feed should theoretically still work for everyone who had from the old blog, but I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure, once I put this post live I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll know.\nüíª So my current workflow is: I have a git repo with all the markdown and website code and I have the live website as a submodule, so whenever I made a change, I export it with Hugo, git commit all changes and GitHub pages just deploys them, feels like magic :D\nüöÄ Speed Oh its much faster, obviously, but look at the changes of before (left) and after (right) using PageSpeed Insights.\nConclusion Still there? Well so far I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the move, I do miss the nice WordPress backend thing if I\u0026rsquo;m being honest, but I can live without it. I feel like in the long run I won\u0026rsquo;t miss having to maintain that server, also the costs. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m editing this on Obsidian, about to commit and see if it goes live, RSS and all. If you find any broken stuff or have suggestions let me know, either mastodon, email or a comment here.\nUntil the next time, where hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about games! Thanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2024/01/converting-the-blog-from-wordpress-to-hugo/","summary":"Yesterday, I shutdown the VPS that has been hosting all my websites for the last ~10 years.

So one of those weeks.\nBut onto game5 progress.\nImporters I managed to finish some of the importers (spreadsheets -\u0026gt; ScriptableObjects + prefabs) that I was working on, right now I can just glance over values on a spreadsheet, tweak, and have it export all the Scriptable Objects, generating the prefabs with corresponding data and images and test them. I could have made the game parse the spreadsheet at boot time and create them, but I decided against it, I want to generate this process offline. One of the reasons is because I have more control over not replacing existing items GUIDs (to keep and existing links), and also I can tweak any individually generated files manually, if I need to.\nTesting \u0026amp; Automation As I start to get more pieces onto the game I‚Äôm hitting the time that I need to start testing what I do, obviously with beta testers etc, but also I need to find a way to test it on my own in an effective way. For bugs, balance and well, fun factor.\nI recall for Quest of Dungeons I had several spreadsheets with the game combat formulas and it would show up curves of progression for each character stat as it levelled up, this helped me visualising pros and cons of each one of them. And even other stuff, like how many total XP points one could get by each floor, or gold, so even with the procedural nature, I knew lower and upper bounds.\nThat meant that even if I never ended up getting a really good, or bad combination of items during my tests, I could see the best and worst case, and I would tweak monsters and boss fights accordingly.\nThis leads me to this game, where given it‚Äôs nature of it‚Äôs progression, I‚Äôm still unsure of the best tools I can cook up to help me on this, before I place it on testers hands. It won‚Äôt be bullet proof but it would be best for me to get a general idea of what to expect.\nAutomation is something I had for QoD and already have it to a certain degree here, an ‚Äúauto playtester‚Äù, basically a script that just does some dumb decisions and plays the game on it‚Äôs own, this doesn‚Äôt give much info but at least I can quicky test over crashes over certain periods of time, I just let it playing on it‚Äôs own. It has limitations but it‚Äôs nice.\nContent As I‚Äôm making importers for content I‚Äôm now starting to replace some testing placeholders with what I think will be final, in terms of mechanics and items, which is why the Testing phase will start to be important as I tweak content and also gameplay values, the fun factor of the game in a way.\nThis step is usually the one I get stuck the most, because as much as I can plan on paper, some things might not work at all when testing, also trying to keep the scope realistic for me, I‚Äôm just one person coding all this, got to be real here. I always think ‚Äúoh 8 items might be too little content‚Äù, but then again sometimes less is more, as long as it‚Äôs well placed. Also being less we can always add more later if needed. Doing work unnecessarily hurts more, on Vizati and QoD locking down content amount like ‚Äú7 floors max, 4 characters, 10 skills per character‚Äù really helped me early on, it was tangible and gives a sense of progression and motivation as we create each one. So that‚Äôs the sort of thing I‚Äôm trying to do here.\nSo that‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm trying to decide this stuff right now, considering the very low time and budget I have available, I‚Äôm trying to realistically get a good scope for what I can do, even if it turns out a short game (and that‚Äôs ok), match everything as close as possible to what I think I‚Äôll need in the end, so I can decide the stage of art, where to get it, or who to hire, or even if it‚Äôs something I could do on my own (some of it anyway). Yeah I know I just described that I‚Äôm lacking a proper GDD üôÇ\nMood So all around I feel a bit more optimistic about game5 this week, but as any game developer will tell you, this feeling goes up and down every given week xD. Sometimes I feel like I might have something here, other times ‚Äúthis sucks‚Äù.\nUntil the next post!\npost feature image from deviantArt, Halloween month! üéÉ (https://www.deviantart.com/hoshi-pan/art/witch-tea-818804167)\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2023/10/game5-devlog-2/","summary":"I missed last week devlog, mostly because I did almost no progress but also because it was a bad week overall, personally and in terms of work, nothing too bad but you know that feeling when you barely made any progress, despite tons of work hours?

I‚Äôll be vague as heck until I‚Äôm sure I have something worth ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a new game‚Äù, if that ever turns out to be the case.\nSo this week‚Äôs it‚Äôs progress on my ‚Äúon-going not yet announced game because not ready and might be bad‚Äù game, which I decided to for now on call Game5 here, so it‚Äôs easier to know what we are talking about.\nNo progress I haven‚Äôt been able to do make progress during the day because of contract work, so it‚Äôs mostly nights and weekends when physically possible. And I‚Äôm actually feeling a bit bad about this, so this might take a while. There‚Äôs been weeks of good productivity followed by weeks/months of just ‚Äúseems to be the same‚Äù. To be honest some design decisions were also blocking me, the initial plan was enough to start but there‚Äôs always some roadblocks ahead.\nDeath by a thousand buttons After QoD I specifically remember saying ‚ÄúMy next game needs to have as little UI as possible‚Äù, but here we are, this game will (probably) live or die depending on how bad it is to use it. I mean the ‚Äúgame‚Äù part has to be fun as well obviously, but there is a lot of interconnection between both. You‚Äôll understand what I mean by that later. No it‚Äôs not an RTS etc.\nSlow progress is better than none But the past 2-3 weeks I got a little lightbulb that gave me a general direction of a way to solve some stuff and it‚Äôs on a good track again I feel. And while there‚Äôs no real need for the UI to look good at this point, I already have 2 iterations of it, mostly from a functional standpoint.\nI did a first prototype with the general idea, not all features, but turned out incredibly cumbersome to use from a UX standpoint. But this was good, I felt there was still something there in terms of ‚Äúgame‚Äù, just needs iteration.\nI ‚Äúquickly‚Äù remade it into a different one recently, and now I feel it‚Äôs much better, there‚Äôs still a lot to do in terms of making it coherent. But this is also the part where I feel I have to focus on the ‚Äútoy‚Äù part of the game itself.\nPlanning A lot of my problems sometimes come from lack of planning some details more carefully, in a way it‚Äôs good to just jump in and get it rolling, but other times it comes back to bite you. With that in mind, and since I now have a general idea of functionalities and a barebones UI, I hired someone to freelance work with me on their spare time on the UI. At this point it‚Äôs compartmentalized enough that if they need to leave to other things I can carry on, and also I can focus a bit more on the gameplay components.\nIteration and Automation I do a lot of notes and value on spreadsheets, that end up on the game, for testing, and especially during prototype phase I found myself copying pasting values around. So I took a couple hours to write some python scripts that grab cvs, parse them and export the proper ScriptableObjects for what I need. This speeds up quick testing and changing values. I was getting tired of changing them directly on Unity inspector.\nNext steps My next move is balancing out a initial progress/difficulty ramp. Right now I have most stuff ‚Äújust there‚Äù, in a sort of chaotic way, to test out the fun of it, but I need to make a proper vertical slice. At this point I do have several mechanics in place, but a lot buggy and a bit all over the place, so I have to streamline that to make it more cohesive. I don‚Äôt have any new mechanics still missing (so far), so just cooking up a small prototype that I could just hand over to someone and have them play, and see what happens.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2023/10/game5-devlog-1/","summary":"Nothing announced, not even a name decided, but I want to vaguely blog about it as a means of brainstorming with myself.

Small relief, as long as we can keep using existing versions with current Terms of Service. This will be impossible on mobile and consoles in a short time frame due to SDKs, but for PC should be fine.\nSo that‚Äôs good huh? Well not quite imo, because the rest pretty much maintains, more or less with some changes, Unity Plus still gone (although expected), but it‚Äôs a revenue/pay-per-install deal, on top of the yearly license fees. I feel they fear they tainted their image so much they aren‚Äôt even forcing the Unity splash screen anymore, probably because players will now fear every Unity game will come with install tracking software.\nI think the subscription plan, especially for mobile/consoles is needed, it‚Äôs a company and needs to make money to maintain the software, fair. However for me it‚Äôs a lot of the break of trust they did, and trying for the SECOND time (that I recall) to change the Terms of Service retroactively and only after industry-wide outrage did they backtracked slightly. So for now the new-new rules only apply to a smaller %, which I guess they expect will calm down most of the community. In a couple years they‚Äôll pull some other stunt and we‚Äôll recall ‚Äúoh right, they did this before‚Äù.\nFurthermore, they had deleted the transparency repo with the Terms of Service from GitHub, which raised many eyebrows, when enquired to why they deleted the answer was ‚Äúlow views so it was deleted‚Äù. The repo is back up meanwhile, I mean, what the heck?\nMoving forward So as I mentioned in last post I have been working on a prototype for what I hope I can turn into a new game, in Unity. I decided that I‚Äôll continue working on the prototype in Unity (actually taking a break from work right now to write this), it would be slightly silly to change now. And when I feel most of the features are done, I‚Äôll try to move to my own tech, yes again.\nI‚Äôve been doing some research and tests and I‚Äôll be dismantling Quest of Dungeons engine, which was all OOP, to adding ECS, using Flecs, this is a major thing I‚Äôm taking with me from my time using Unity, I like that it helps solving a lot of issues sometimes, even if full ECS is not the solution for me. But having that will be nice, I can see the benefit now. Another thing might also be trying to mimick Prefabs and/or ScriptableObjects, that would be nice, but that‚Äôs just in the back of my head at the moment. I already started the process of integrating Flecs, so slowly and gradually, and hopefully, when it‚Äôs time to switch engine it will be a suitable alternative. If not well, better not update to 2023LTS I guess.\nAt least this is the plan right now, who knows, maybe I‚Äôll reach a point where it feels too frustrating to rewrite it all in a different engine and language (c# to cpp), or ran out of budget to do so, plans do change. But at the moment at least it moves forward like this.\nList of mostly open-source game engines and frameworks Using suggestions I compiled a list of game engines and frameworks, mostly open-source and free, but there are a few with licenses, regardless, for anyone looking to test alternatives, there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff.\nhttps://github.com/DJLink/list-of-game-engines-and-frameworks\nMy personal suggestion for anyone who wants to try the ‚Äúmake my own engine‚Äù approach, for 2D stuff (don‚Äôt get too deep the rabbit hole on 3D), will be to use SDL to bootstrap window creation, input etc. I‚Äôve used that in a bunch of stuff in the past and can vouch for it.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2023/09/unity-enshittification-round-2-moving-on-to-custom-tech/","summary":"After mostly a week of anxiety, for thousands and thousands of developers, Unity changed the rules again, and first glance, it‚Äôs better for the immediate problems it would cause for active and in-development games.

Unity, one of the most well know, and used game engines out there, after years of doing mostly good for the community, pulled a reverse card and broke years of trust the community had on them. Unity announced that they are retroactively charging (for example $0.2) for each game install, after developers hit a certain yearly revenue threshold, which sounds insane.\nAlso they are removing the Plus subscription, which honestly this one I was kind of expecting for a while now. Which means a lot of people would have to jump to the nearly $2k yearly subscriptions. This on it‚Äôs own, while a big jump, at least is more understandable, building tech is expensive. The pay-per-install is crazy though.\nOn top of all, the thing that breaks trust the most, is the retroactive thing, games already released on older versions will be affected. The Terms of Service for those older versions, which developers agreed on installing X version, are no longer valid, they changed them, which means it‚Äôs no longer safe to trust the rules, Unity can just flip them. What‚Äôs for tomorrow?\nProprietary tech This is, and always be one of the downsides of depending on other people technology, if the whole company depends on it, and there‚Äôs no easy replacement, a drastic change can hurt the whole business bad. This is not to say that we must avoid it 100% of the time, but it clearly shows that if a company amasses too much power, murphy‚Äôs law!\nI usually like to discuss this subject, even before this whole thing, not because I think everyone should do custom engines (even if fun) but because we shouldn‚Äôt trick ourselves in believing ‚Äúmy choice of engine is forever!‚Äù, it won‚Äôt be, unless it‚Äôs our own tech that we spend tons of time supporting/improving it, everything else eventually mutates too much, fades or gets killed. So we should always try to at the very least, be mentally prepared.\nA very large amount of developers probably entered gamedev through Unity, it was mostly the goto suggestion everyone gave, and never tried anything else (and why would they, if it worked right?), but after years of learning that tool, it might be frustrating to change, but trust me, you got this. It will be hard, but if you ever change again it will be easier.\nWhat I‚Äôm up to Personally I‚Äôve been using Unity for the ~5 years maybe, mostly for contract work and porting stuff. But recently, and after years of shipping stuff on custom framework I decided to work on my current game prototype in Unity, it made sense, my day work is 80% on that tech, built in Editor, multi-platform, so I would also be learning more and prototyping in Unity is generally quite fun. But these changes now mean I‚Äôll be changing for something else, not because these rules will affect me, I don‚Äôt see ever reaching the $200k yearly, but because I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll do next. I‚Äôd rather risk elsewhere.\nWhat next? For the past couple days I‚Äôve trying to decide on exactly where, but haven‚Äôt made my mind yet. But I have decided that I‚Äôll at least try to wrap up the prototype phase in Unity, makes sense, game is still a bit barebones (why I‚Äôm not talking about it yet) but there‚Äôs a lot done, so I‚Äôd rather pass the whole ‚Äútoy prototyping messy code‚Äù in Unity, and when it feels time to move to production port the whole thing elsewhere and in the process hopefully have a cleaner code base.\nCustom or another engine I‚Äôm unsure, but atm I‚Äôm leaning more towards custom, but that would mean I‚Äôd probably either reshape my entire custom engine, or do from scratch, reason being, it‚Äôs 100% object oriented, and while working with Unity I discovered there‚Äôs tons of advantages to the Entity Component System, so I want that on my framework. Might be more initial setup, but after shipping a couple games on tons of platforms in OOP, I discovered that some of the issues would have been easier to solve with ECS, not all but several.\nOverall I‚Äôm excited about the possibility of working on my own tech, because well, it‚Äôs fun. As for my next game, progress has been slow, because I‚Äôm still taking the approach of contract work, and working on it on my spare time until it feels like a viable project and deciding full or part-time.\nAfter working on Quest of Dungeons for many years (which I‚Äôm grateful) I did several prototypes that were, to be honest, not good games, and I will never ship something that at the very least I don‚Äôt find fun, so yeah sorry it‚Äôs been a while. The hope is that if I find it fun, more people will, so until that time, work moves on, maybe I‚Äôll have more news about something sooner than later.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2023/09/the-unity-enshittification-proprietary-tech-dangers-and-mostly-not-talking-about-what-im-doing/","summary":"So this was an ‚Äúeventful‚Äù week in the game dev community.

It‚Äôs always inevitable we have to change elements in a game when targeting a new console/device we never considered, but some considerations, if done from start can save a lot of time, headaches, porting budget, and equally important, avoiding introduction of new bugs due to code changing drastically. These are based on observations I made on a couple dozen projects that crossed my desk, I don‚Äôt expect this to be news for someone who‚Äôs been in the field for a while, and might even be ‚Äútoo basic‚Äù for many, but hopefully it can help someone, since I‚Äôve seen these many times.\nMany of these are not specific to a certain game engine (unless noted), so they can be used anywhere, it‚Äôs just a collection of things I‚Äôve encountered while porting games which can help.\nDon‚Äôt hard-code strings in your code.\nThis is one of the most well know ones and it‚Äôs not specific to games either, any software, but there‚Äôs still a lot of games that have it. It‚Äôs not hard to happen either, a gamejam or prototype starts, even if just a couple some strings that we leave near a //todo:, but suddenly we‚Äôre months in development with strings all over the place. Now you need to add another language and it‚Äôs a problem. Write some get_localization(ID) function, read all text from a file as early as possible. Also never write them directly on images, even if it looks prettier, it‚Äôs going to be a problem trust me, you don‚Äôt want image variations of each language, I can tell you first hand that becomes big problem whenever small text changes are required.\nAvoid string concatenation in localizable text as much as possible.\nIf we need to mix in dynamic content with text, very common but this examples poses an issue:\nstring label = localize(‚ÄúOur score is ‚Äú) + to_string(int_value) + localize(‚Äú, which is very good!‚Äù);\nThis is not very flexible when it comes to localization. It assumes 2 different strings being localized, and the phrase has to make sense in all languages in this order, and that‚Äôs not always the case, what if a certain language needs the value to be in a different place in the concat order? The person localising won‚Äôt have any way to do it.\nSo let‚Äôs look at this example:\nstring label = localize(‚ÄúOur score is {0}, which is very good!‚Äù, int_value);\nMany languages have string utils to allow this, the {0} will be replaced with our variable, which means that the localisation team can put the {0} wherever they want, your code only assumes there‚Äôs a {0} somewhere, doesn‚Äôt matter where.\nSeparate Accept/Back button bindings in menus from other gameplay actions.\nLet‚Äôs say our game uses the A button on a controller to Fire a bullet, it‚Äôs also the most appropriate button for the ‚Äúaccept‚Äù action on a menu button. We might be tempted to only query for a ‚Äúfire‚Äù action everywhere, but that‚Äôs not the best idea. First of all if you later need to change that ‚Äúfire‚Äù to something else you break menus, and more, on some platforms you might need a different button, for example PS4 in Japan the X button might not be ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù but O instead, so you‚Äôd have to flip your mapping, having them separate prevents breaking the whole code. If you want to read more about the PS4 specific case here‚Äôs a good article about the subject https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18255901/ps4-x-o-cross-circle-remap-firmware-6-50-dualshock-4\nLeaving unused assets/textures on scenes/projects\nThis is not necessarily a porting issue on it‚Äôs own, but can hurt performance on lower spec devices and it‚Äôs something I encountered more on Unity. I get it, it‚Äôs still development phase, something gets removed, but we leave it on the scene disabled, that on it‚Äôs own might not be a problem, but let‚Äôs say the object happens to be an entire older level that we remade better, and wanna keep the old one around ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. It will be imported to the final build, all the meshes, textures etc, the level might be loaded, just not used. A variety of times I‚Äôve seen build sizes reduce a lot just be removing unused things, but this is a more complicated process after the game is done, because they might be hard to spot, my example was an obvious one, but dozens of tiny things won‚Äôt, someone looking might just think disabled stuff will be activate later in script somewhere.\nGigantic non power of 2 textures\nThis is a recurring issue I see, a couple texture asset packs etc, really big textures, works on PC, even uncompressed. Many textures that are non power of two textures, you target another lower spec device and now there‚Äôs a problem, most engines will allow NPOT textures on their pipeline, but for example Unity won‚Äôt even allow compression, because it will only happen on POT textures, this is because, textures like 256√ó256, 512√ó512, 1024√ó1024, to keep it short and a bit more simplistic, is a form of optimisation for images feed in to the GPU pipeline. Many years ago most devices wouldn‚Äôt even allow something like 125√ó125, you‚Äôd need to find the next POT value, 128√ó128. A game with big textures in weird sizes will use immensely more disk space than if we use POT and some compression.\nParticles\nThey look pretty, it‚Äôs easy to get distracted, don‚Äôt start by high particle count and go down until it looks good. Start by 1 and go up until it looks good. I‚Äôve seen particle systems with 100 particles look nearly the same as a 5000 one, multiple that with a couple explosions on screen and you got yourself a problem.\nNaming controller buttons in text\n‚ÄúPress A to jump‚Äù\nBut on PlayStation it might be ‚ÄúPress X to jump‚Äù\nInject a way in your code so that strings where you use buttons are parsed in runtime, and you can query the platform for the button itself. If it‚Äôs just a button sprite on a menu, it‚Äôs relatively easier, you just need a sprite and flip it accordingly. For written text like a tutorial or a message somewhere there are several ways to accomplish that, and one way might be to put the icons directly on a font.\nFor example\n‚ÄúPress A to jump‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúPress [JUMP_BUTTON] to jump‚Äù, and then in code you can search and replace [JUMP_BUTTON] with a glyph in your font that corresponds to the right controller button. That way localization team can write it in any order, and the code simply replaces it. Another advantage of this is if instead of actual glyphs you want to write it, you can also localize it.\nImagine ‚ÄúMove Left Thumbstick to walk‚Äù, in another language we might want to change the part ‚ÄúLeft Thumbstick‚Äù to something else, probably by console certification requirements, so having ‚ÄúMove [Left_Thumbstick] to walk‚Äù can help here with the string find replace, you get the idea.\nAvoid constant file saving\nDisk access even if faster these days is a big bottleneck, that‚Äôs why loading something takes, well‚Ä¶ time. A few times I saw cases where games would save something every time a certain action happened, and I‚Äôm not talking about game progress checkpoints, which is fine, but for example a game wants to save ‚Äústeps taken‚Äù for some stats, and it would auto-save a certain file every time. Needless to say, while it might not be a problem on PC (SSDs etc) even if wrong, but on certain consoles that will not only be a problem, as well as a possible certification failure. So bulk up actions to save, and save them once in a while, the ones that don‚Äôt require the player to press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù, you can also enforce saving on application quit.\nFramerate consideration\nIf you coded the game to consider 60FPS only, not considering that it might have to be locked at 30FPS due to lower hardware, using what we can call fixed delta (time since last update) this will be a big problem. If your character movement isn‚Äôt taking into account different framerate, for example Unity has FixedUpdate() and Update(), you‚Äôll have problems later if you can‚Äôt reach the 60FPS for some reason, everything in-game will run much slower as we only get half the updates. And this is much harder to change later in development, most of the game feel \u0026amp; calculations might be tied into those values. This is an article explaining it from a Unity perspective but you‚Äôll get the idea. https://gamedevplanet.com/delta-time-vs-fixed-delta-time-differences-and-purposes/\nThat‚Äôs it for now\nI‚Äôll probably update it if I think of something else, there are many other things specific for each engine but I just tried to focus mostly on engine-agnostic stuff. If all these are covered this already helps a lot most of the port work. Let me know if you find errors or have any other suggestions.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2023/09/some-things-to-consider-in-multi-platform-gamedev/","summary":"Decided to write a couple things I feel can help a game in the long run when it comes to porting it to other platforms.

Among other platforms one that keeps showing up as an alternative is Mastodon, but change is always hard, some people have been on Twitter for years, so what exactly makes this any different?\nI created a Mastodon back in 2018 but never really payed much attention to it, I have to be honest, there weren‚Äôt as many people using it back then, I lost interest a bit fast, and I never really got past the ‚Äújust another social network‚Äù. But recently things changed, a LOT of people have joined, it feels more alive, and I started to look more into the decentralised nature of it, which is the opposite of Twitter centralised, and one of it‚Äôs best weapons at keeping ppl stuck there, you‚Äôve build up a network, if you leave, it‚Äôs all gone.\nOk so right now one of the problems with Twitter is, either you agree with how things are or not, but your profile is locked on that platform, if you leave all is gone, followers, posts etc, you start from scratch elsewhere. This was never particularly too much of any issue until now, I wanna keep in touch with people I follow, updates on their work, they are leaving, ideally I should be able to follow them if they leave twitter server, regardless if I wanna move or not.\nBut let‚Äôs start by the similarities, on Mastodon you can make posts (the tweets), follow people, be followed, make lists, search hashtags, post pictures etc, on the surface level, give or take, it‚Äôs more or less the same, but Mastodon gives us more control on a couple levels, but one of the best features might be the decentralisation.\nAnd this is were the big differences show up, Mastodon doesn‚Äôt exist in a single place, Twitter entry point is twitter.com, everyone logins there, and everything is there, if Twitter closes tomorrow, they own all the data, everything is gone.\nBut with Mastodon anyone can make a new server, based on interests, topics, workplace, whatever. By now you might be asking\nBut that just means everyone is a different place, multiple servers, where do I join, that sounds too much work, what if I join a server with few people or that stagnates?\nAll good questions, which I made myself, but here‚Äôs where the decentralised part enters, all Mastodon servers talk with each other, so you can follow people from any server, get their notifications and talk with them, regardless of where you created your account, they are all connected. On top of that, you can migrate your account to different servers if you don‚Äôt agree with any new rules, it‚Äôs too crowded, or too empty or you just wanna go to a new one, you can even run your own server, just your account, and never be isolated, I‚Äôm following 3 people who run their own instance, and it doesn‚Äôt matter.\nThe server you choose matters for the Local Timeline, where you see a feed of all updates from anyone in the server you choose, so in my case, I joined the https://mastodon.gamedev.place and I see a local timeline with a lot of gamedev content, but there is also a Federated tab, which shows updates from all Mastadon instances, like a ‚Äúglobal feed‚Äù list.\nSo we have 3 levels:\n‚ÄìThe people you follow: doesn‚Äôt matter which server they are on, you‚Äôll see their stuff.\n‚ÄìThe Local Feed: here it will matter the server you pick, you see content of all people in your server, but don‚Äôt worry, don‚Äôt like it? Move your account to another one.\n‚ÄìThe Federated Feed: Posts from people in from the whole network related to the people you follow.\nBut you can just see the people you follow of course, you have a lot of control, nothing forces you to see stuff from people you don‚Äôt follow.\nAll this together has been very interesting to me, because that means as we grow a userbase on Mastodon, if somewhere in the future we are unhappy with the server picked, we can move, create our own and still keep our data, just elsewhere, still following the same people. It‚Äôs a different kind of concept which has tremendous potential in a future where we want to be more and more in control of our own data.\nIf people you are following created Mastodon accounts there are a few tools you can use to find them, these will search their bios for Mastodon links, or even if someone you follow on Twitter used the same tool to search, which means they have an account. I used these and found several people I was following, as time passes more will join so running the tools in a couple weeks will probably bring more results. After you use it, it will export a .csv file which you can use to import on Mastodon, don‚Äôt forget to use ‚Äúmerge‚Äù and not ‚Äúreplace‚Äù.\nhttps://pruvisto.org/debirdify/\nfedifinder.glitch.me\nhttps://twitodon.com\nI‚Äôm not leaving Twitter for now, but I‚Äôm actively using Mastodon, can‚Äôt hurt, and it‚Äôs kind of exciting, I‚Äôm meeting a ton of new developers.

I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs incoherent, this is mostly a dump of thoughts.\nFor those who follow my work a bit more closely you probably know that for almost 4 years the project I dedicated more time was Quest of Dungeons, which started development in 2013.\nRight now I still have one more platform to release, on Playstation 4, 17 January 2017, it passed certification, ready to be released, so for the first time in years it feels that my QoD journey is finally completing. I still intend to patch the Android port with all last updates and sure, there will always be patches and things to take care of, but it will be in a whole different way now. Until now it always felt incomplete and a never ending task that extended for months, years.\nWorking for so much time on the same project can be incredibly frustrating, especially if working alone, so one thing that I‚Äôm proud of myself is that I actually finished it. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the amount of times that I said ‚ÄúF** it, is not worth it‚Äù. Things went good with the game, in a sense that I was able to put it on a lot of platforms and it was well received for the most part.\nI think I was able to find a good ‚Äúniche‚Äù of players that understood what QoD was all about, with all its flaws and good things.\nThe game was never meant to be released outside of PC, heck, during the first month of development it was a Tablet only game. That led to decisions that I regretted later when porting to consoles, but also allowed me to cut corners and not caring about things that weren‚Äôt meant for a PC game early on, thus speeding up development time. I spent a lot of time just rethinking the whole interface for each new platform (except PS4 which is identical to Xbox One) and that is time consuming, not to mention specific console features, on the other hand players do feel like it was hand-crafted for their device, so there‚Äôs that. Each new platform was made possible with the previous one, so it‚Äôs not something that I can say it was a total mistake.\nTechnology wise, I‚Äôve kept using my own tech for all releases, stubbornness perhaps? And that is not without it‚Äôs caveats. With engines like Unreal 4, Unity and Gamemaker these days if feels almost ridiculous to consider building your own tech for many, but not for me, not yet anyway. I used other engines in the past, I did release my first 2 games on XNA, and after that I decided that it was time to build my own tech, so I could be more flexible and not caring if an engine is discontinued or not, that was the goal. And on that part it succeeded, the same code runs on all platforms, except for specific render, input, etc. It took work, a lot, and after so many platforms I have a better idea of things that need better abstraction, in fact for the past week I‚Äôve been just cleaning up code for future projects, feels more robust now. But I have a bit of regret of platforms that I ported the engine and possibly will never use it again, like Wii U, maybe even Nintendo 3DS. While the others, now that the work is done I can reuse for future games, it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôll never use for some again, so it was an effort for a one time only, and that is a problem, one that could have been prevented by using an existent engine.\nI tried using Unity for 3 weeks, did some tests with GameMaker, and it was a cool experience, knowledge doesn‚Äôt hurt right? But haven‚Äôt made my mind yet about switching away from my own tech, mostly because I know it well, I can quickly changes things around for each project and mostly because I love working on that part as well, it‚Äôs fun, even if it‚Äôs just for me. I‚Äôll revisit this if/when I need to switch to a ‚Äúfull 3d‚Äù game.\nSo many platforms!!\nIt‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs on a lot of devices now, and there are several reasons to do so, more audience, chance to make more money, get the game more known, etc, brand recognition and proving the studio is capable of delivering. I also made it because I had the chance right now, I don‚Äôt know the future, may not be able to pull that again, also it was a chance to establish a relation with Steam, Xbox, Nintendo and Sony. My idea is to keep making games for platforms that each makes sense, but trying to cut down time between each release. It was too sparse now, because of the reasons mentioned above.\nMarketing is still something I suck at, I do have a twitter account where I talk about my games, but also about tons of other stuff, mostly movies and general day things, is that even called marketing? Too late I decided to setup a newsletter list and put it on Upfall Studios website, should have done it earlier, I got 100 people to subscribe in the last year and half, I could have way more in these nearly 7 years as indie dev.\nI also created a twitter account for Upfall Studios, so it‚Äôs basically a cleaned up version of my own, just news about the games and launches, a more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù account I call it. Taking care of so many social stuff, twitter, facebook, etc is time consuming and doesn‚Äôt come to me as naturally as using my personal account, so that is still a problem probably. For the most part I follow devs and not ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù even when they are indies, so that‚Äôs mostly what I like to do, chances are there are more people like me.\nCommunity (love you guys)\nI like responding to people, I don‚Äôt mind getting asked questions and I‚Äôve answered to 100% of emails I got, either about the game or gamedev in general. I‚Äôve taken time to meet other developers in person when they wanna ask me questions. Treat others the way you wanna be treated, easy right?\nI‚Äôve been extremely luck with the players and community surrounding QoD, they are nice, active in recommending the game to friends and I couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better community. Goal is to keep incrementing the amount of course =)\nNever lie or go on radio silence regarding customers. There are tons of Early access games that suddenly stop and not even a goodbye post, that‚Äôs the worse part, the waiting for months to see if project is alive. They won‚Äôt trust you again, even if you switch to a different studio, they won‚Äôt forget. So if project fails explain it, if you are delayed on a patch say so. Almost all the time players will understand and be supportive. When I was making the Xbox One and Nintendo ports I had to delay the PC updates for a couple months and players were really supportive, as long as they know why you are late on some promise.\nIt‚Äôs never just ‚ÄúX more months of dev‚Äù\nNEVER, ever, if you think it‚Äôs just 2 more months, odds are that it‚Äôs 4 more. We suck at calculating time for the most part (or at least I do), because we conceive the game in your minds and you can see it, mostly complete, but making that happen takes much more time. PC version was delayed, both Xbox and Nintendo ports took much longer than I expected, the PS4 one was shorted, because I counted with worst case scenario but things went well at first try. In my experience completing the game 1-2 months before the release can have a positive effect, especially for a 1 man team. I finished the Xbox One version 2 months before, full approved on certification, and spent that time just trying to promote it, and was able to gather some awareness for the game. I finished the Nintendo versions just 10 days before, and even had to delay the game once, I regret now that I didn‚Äôt calculated/handled things better. Lesson learned, let‚Äôs see if I don‚Äôt make that mistake again.\nEverything else\nI made that mistake in the past and I still do, I can‚Äôt separate well development time and actual life time, so I end up working too many hours, and it‚Äôs addicting.\nQoD was made partially at night when I still had a day job, and the last 1 and a half year in full time, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I was able to do twice as much work unfortunately.\nWhen you work for someone else you have a schedule, but if you work on your own time, it‚Äôs harder. Most people tell me it‚Äôs hard to stay focused working, and I have that problem too, but not in a way that I can‚Äôt work, but mostly because I blend in leisure time with work, and working from home doesn‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs easy to get distracted, then you feel guilty and spend a couple more hours working. And while I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm super slow, I could be using my time better. That‚Äôs something I want to change, I don‚Äôt thing strict work schedules work well, but not having clear boundaries doesn‚Äôt either. If anyone is managing this well please let me know. Open to suggestions üôÇ\nIt‚Äôs easy to find people saying this, but I‚Äôve now experienced it myself, when you have a problem that you can‚Äôt solve don‚Äôt spend hours on the PC, take a walk, go do something else, the solution will come to mind, seriously, it works very often. You trick your mind into something else and the other problem keeps getting solved in the background.\nWhat now?\nIn approximately 3 weeks the PS4 version will be released, I don‚Äôt any plans for more ports so I intend to move to a new game, and honestly I‚Äôm scared, I don‚Äôt have a solid idea yet, been mostly sketching ideas or trying some prototypes, and the thought of deciding ‚Äúlet me spend 1-2 years‚Äù in this new game is a bit scary, ‚Äúcan I come up with all the money?‚Äù, ‚Äúwill it be good?‚Äù.\nI wish I had a small cool idea to try for a couple months instead of a bigger one, but as I mentioned before, QoD was also supposed to be a 6 months project that turned out into 4 years so better not force anything. I‚Äôm trying not to think of ‚Äúthis is gonna be a cool idea that everyone will like‚Äù and instead trying to come up again with something that I would like to play, even if others don‚Äôt like it, development flows more naturally like that.\nOh and I want to take 2 weeks of proper vacations after the PS4 release, haven‚Äôt had vacations in over two years, thinking of backpacking a couple countries, it‚Äôs cheaper and it‚Äôs good ‚Äúmind food‚Äù-\nStill there? thanks for reading ‚Äì David\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2016/12/some-thoughts-about-a-4-year-game-dev-cycle/","summary":"As I‚Äôm starting to write this post I‚Äôm on my way to my home town for the holidays, so I may not post it in a couple days.\nIt‚Äôs been a crazy year(s)(?) and I‚Äôm taking these near 4h of travel to write down some things.

But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I‚Äôm juggling between two ports on my own.\nFrom a technical point of view, both are already up and running, graphics, sound, input, all of that is working (as far as I tested anyway. bugs yikes).\nI had to greatly optimize some portions of the code for the 3DS version, because I want to try to target 60FPS, let‚Äôs see if I can accomplish that.\nWii U is obviously a more powerful machine so the pre-existing game code from the Xbox version, after I ported it to the Wii U, just ran.\nSo if the game is running, what is left?\nI‚Äôm doing specific features for both versions, and that takes time. Both consoles have a second touch screen for example, so I had to come up with a feasible way to use them.\nWii U\nOn Wii U you can play the traditional way, TV, but I also added off-tv support, so you can play just on the GamePad screen. I have Pro Controller support and another way you can play is a mix between TV and gamepad screen, where you can use a touch based inventory, map, etc to manage things.\nYou can even play with the Pro Controller, and watch the game on the gamepad screen, as a tiny TV. I spent the last few weeks adding these changes which I hope will prove useful for players.\nBottom line is: Yes, you can play only with buttons, like a ‚Äúregular‚Äù game, but if you want, there is some gamepad use, but it‚Äôs optional.\nNintendo 3DS\nThe 3DS version is proving to be the most challenging one, first there were some technical issues I had to overcome, now is trying to fit all content in both those screens in a coherent way. If you played the other versions you know there is a fair amount of menus/UI at the user disposal, either to check inventory, character equipment, skills, buffs, quests, stats, etc.\nUI/Dual Screen\nI started by doing a 2 screen split-inventory, imagine the Xbox One but kind of split between 2 screens. So the list was on the top screen, and the item description on the bottom one. And that worked.\nOLD\nHowever I was never 100% happy with it, and I was barely using touch, which despite not being a personal favorite, I know I lot of people like, so I decided to throw all away and redo it differently. In a way that players could either touch items to open description (the second screen on the previous version) and then Eat/Equip/etc, but also that with a button press you can use it too, via dpad and a/b/x/y.\nThis is posing some challenges since I‚Äôm now trying to put everything that was on 2 screens into a single one, but I‚Äôll get there.\nThis is still WIP but I feel I‚Äôm getting near something a bit better.\nNEW (WIP)\nStreetPass\nI never considered using StreetPass, but the other day I woke up with a cool idea. When you StreetPass someone you send and receive ghosts from previous runs to the other user. Here‚Äôs how it works, when you die, the game saves your character as it is, stats, equipment, etc. There is later a chance, that in a new game you might encounter yourself, but now you will also send those ghosts to the other players. So when you find ghosts from other users (they will have a icon in-game to make it different) if you defeat them, you‚Äôll get all the loot. Cool right?\nFinal reminder, everything discussed here is WIP so it can change.\nSo still no ETA, but I‚Äôm getting closer. And that is it for now. I‚Äôll let you guys know when I have more news.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2016/05/qod-3dswii-u-port-devlog-1/","summary":"So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?\nIt‚Äôs been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it‚Äôs time to talk about what‚Äôs been happening in the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.\nI‚Äôm working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release.

This wouldn‚Äôt be possible without everyone who supported me, in one way or another, so even if I do work a lot to make the best possible I can, if no one cared, it wouldn‚Äôt be possible, so thank you.\nIndie life\nI took the jump to full time indie developer this year again, back in March, it wasn‚Äôt something I was planning, but was semi forced to do because of some internal restructuring the company was having, so I left. With the Xbox One port of Quest of Dungeons in hands, and falling behind on my personal deadlines, I decided to risk take a couple months and finish it. One one hand I have more freedom, and can work on games, on the other hand there‚Äôs the constant fear of ‚Äúthis is the last month‚Äù if everything fails and games stop selling. I also decided to start taking care of myself health-wise, by exercising more regularly, and for the most part of the year I did almost everyday a 6-8 KM fast-paced walk right after waking up, overall I fell much better, which helps with the mood and work altogether. The weird thing is that I had to get a gadget in order to feel more motivated, got a fitbit that tracks daily activity, been wearing it for 10 months now, so gamificating health ftw. Personal note, take some proper vacations next year, and by proper I mean, in any place, but disconnected from emails/work and whatever.\nQoD on Xbox One\nWhen I left in March, I was already way behind on my original launch plans, because developing for a console is a whole different thing and doing it during nights only was quickly draining my energies.\nThe following months were mainly devoted to finishing the game, I had to redo a lot of the UI and gameplay to accommodate a game controller and other stuff, but eventually on September 4 I finally released it and I was genuinely surprised by the overwhelming positive feedback, since, at that point the game was out for some time in its PC and Mobile form, but the new additions/changes and the fact that you could play it with a controller for the first time made it more appealing for many people.\nLooking back, it took me a full year, from getting the game approved to the actual release. While it‚Äôs a lot of time, I also think it was worth it, a lot of the game was tweaked, also for some part I still had my day job, certifications take some time also. In fact the final build was finished around June, I just took those ‚Äúextra‚Äù months to finding bugs/polishing and start to approach journalists/websites.\nGDC/Gamescom\nOne of the things I‚Äôve always wanted to attend, at least once, was GDC (Game Developers Conference), and this year I was finally able to, to the European one, which despite being expensive, is still less expensive then traveling to the US. And of course since it‚Äôs on the same week, I also went to Gamescom, and it was amazing, it‚Äôs much bigger then EGX, I had no idea. During GDC I was able to meet tons of cool developers, attend some parties (which is usually not my thing) and learn a lot overall.\nI was also able to watch a Video Games Live concert for the first time, and I loved it, even got a photo with Tommy Tallarico.\nNow \u0026amp; Future(?)\nWith the release of the XO version, a lot of people are asking what am I doing right now, ‚ÄúAre you on vacation?‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew game?‚Äù. I can definitely say that I‚Äôm not on vacation mode right now, I‚Äôm already working on something for next year, which is kind of a semi-secret right now, mostly because I‚Äôm still unsure if I can pull it off. I started working on a concept for a new game, but something unexpected came up and it‚Äôs possible that Quest of Dungeons will get a new port, but now is not the time to talk about it, because at this point is not 100% sure it will, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working on now.\nOn a final note, another thing that comes to mind is that I‚Äôve been blogging way less, I used to post a lot more stuff, especially tutorials of some kind, and I haven‚Äôt, so one of the things I wanna change is to write at least one post a month next year. It happened very little this year because I‚Äôve been mostly working with NDA stuff and it‚Äôs hard to ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how I fixed this‚Äù.\nHappy New year!\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2015/12/year-review-log-2015/","summary":"Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost new year again.\nIt became a habit of mine to to hit pause for a couple minutes, look back, write about it and think about what‚Äôs next, this helps me to sort things out.\nThank you\nI have to start with something, a big Thank You for all the people who purchased QoD, everyone who helped spreading the word, the ones who wrote emails, tweeted and help my solo developer work became an even better thing to do.","title":"year review log 2015"},{"content":"Hi everyone,\nQuest of Dungeons was released on Xbox One exactly a month ago, and the response has been very positive from both players and reviewers, so I decided to list a couple review links here.

A lot of the UI was remade to allow proper gamepad support, several bugs and tweaks were made, and even new features. Lets take a closer look.\nIn game First of all, here‚Äôs how it looks in game, a very minimalist UI if I might say so.\nNext the new Inventory system, instead of several menus (that you could use the mouse with ease to navigate) everything was transformed to fit into a single big integrated menu to use with the Xbox one controller.\nI also added a quick navigation menu to switch between skills, and while you can still use the above Inventory to access skills, this one proved quicker and less intrusive to switch during combat (even if the game is turn-based). You just press a key and voil√°!\nSome of the new features New mansion and custom mode\nAfter you finish Omphar you will have access to another new mansion called Rackan, and a custom game mode, where you can choose amount of floors (within a certain range), dungeon size and difficulty. Also in custom the floors themes are mixed in so you usually get a different ‚Äúflavor‚Äù each time.\nNew class\nAlso after finishing the game you have access to the Necrodancer, which is a bonus character that mixes in several of the other classes, It‚Äôs very cool to play with especially if you played the original game.\nGhost Hero Another cool thing is that you can now find yourself in ghost from a previous run. When you die, your character goes into limbo, when you create a new dungeon there‚Äôs a chance you might encounter yourself. If you defeat your ghost you get everything he still has.\nSettings Main screen The main screen has a different image.\nUI size\nBecause most people play far from the television all UI is scaled at 2x. However, if you connect your Xbox One to a monitor and play close, you can set to 1x (which I personally think it‚Äôs better for viewing up close). You can also scale the game itself to 2x if you prefer, again it‚Äôs a matter of personal preference, depending on your setup.\nScreen area Since the Xbox version will be mostly to run on Television screens there are a couple of specific options, like a screen area, because some television cut a percentage of the screen, you have an option to put the UI on a smaller area.\nKey Binding\nThere is a settings screen for rebinding some of the game controller buttons.\nLanguage It‚Äôs possible to choose different languages (other than English)\nOh and last but not least, here‚Äôs the game cover for Xbox One üôÇ\nAlso I want to show you what I‚Äôve done to my own controller.\nAwesome right?\nAnd that‚Äôs it for now, there are several other tweaks and improvements, but I won‚Äôt get into detail.

I decided to jump in and try to port the whole thing. As a primary goal I want to keep as much native code as possible, because it‚Äôs already working, porting it to Java could only lead to further bugs in the process.\nTools\nAfter some digging I found that you can use Visual Studio to code for Android (oh happy dayyy).\nVisual Studio 2010: http://www.visualstudio.com/pt-br/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx\nVS-Android: https://code.google.com/p/vs-android/\nAndroid NDK, Revision 10 : https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html\nAndroid SDK : http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\nant-1.9.4: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi\njdk 1.8.0: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\nDependencies\nMy next concern were some dependencies that I have on the other versions:\nOpenAL ‚Äì for sound card access\nVorbis ‚Äì for OGG load/parsing\nFreeType 2 ‚Äì for ttf loading\nTinyXML ‚Äì XML parser\nFortunately all of these were possible to compile to Android.\nApplication\nAs an entry point I used android_native_app_glue which comes with the NDK, this way you can skip all Java (I have 0 lines of java code in the game)\nAnother important thing is this line, telling our manifest file that we have no Java code\n\u0026lt;application android:hascode=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; android:label=\u0026#34;@string/app_name\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Resource Loading Usually you just need to do fopen(filename) to open a file. For each platform I would just have to concern with knowing the root folder of where the resources are. But Android works differently, all resources are compressed and you need to use AAssetManager to load them. This proceeds to unpack the file and retrieve a pointer to it. At least this is what I managed to understand from the process.\nAAsset* asset = AAssetManager_open(android_asset_manager, filename, 0); But this caused a big problem, some of the dependencies, like TinyXML receive a string and proceeds to load file file using fopen(). This meant remaking all frameworks, which is not a very good perspective.\nI had some code using fopen and the fact that some external libs used it too posed a problem. I actually spent a couple of days contemplating what would be the best approach but after some research I found a very simple solution.\n#define fopen(name, mode) android_file_open(name, mode) FILE* android_file_open(const char* fname, const char* mode); Now every fopen will be replaced with android_file_open\nAs for the function itself it will try to open the file with AssetManager and return a FILE*\nI also did a small hack that if you try to open the file with write permissions \u0026lsquo;w\u0026rsquo;, it will use the standard fopen, that way we can properly write files to the user documents, for save game data and other stuff.\nFILE* android_file_open(const char* fname, const char* mode) { if(mode[0] == \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;){ #undef fopen return fopen(fname,mode); } #define fopen(name, mode) android_fopen(name, mode) AAsset* asset = AAssetManager_open(android_asset_manager, fname, 0); if(asset) return funopen(asset, android_file_read, android_file_write, android_file_seek, android_file_close); #undef fopen return fopen(fname,mode); } static int android_file_read(void* cookie, char* buf, int size) { return AAsset_read((AAsset*)cookie, buf, size); } static int android_file_write(void* cookie, const char* buf, int size) { return 0; } static fpos_t android_file_seek(void* cookie, fpos_t offset, int whence) { return AAsset_seek((AAsset*)cookie, offset, whence); } static int android_file_close(void* cookie) { AAsset_close((AAsset*)cookie); return 0; } Now just adding this line to the makefile to force the game/libraries to pre-include our file before everything else\nLOCAL_CFLAGS := -g -include android_file_open.h So now all my fopen code works perfectly without any change.\nOpenGL I was using GLES for the iOS version already so I had no problems with the code itself, I did however had some problems with performance on older devices, for example 2010 devices with version 2.3 (the game targets 2.3+)\nEspecially on this function glCopyTexSubImage2D\nThe game uses some 2d soft shadows for giving a nice atmosphere, it\u0026rsquo;s updated once in a while and I just used glCopyTexSubImage2D with a 256x256 texture instead of a VBO because it worked perfectly on everything else (including all iOS devices), but turns out this is very slow on older Android devices, so I ended up adding an option to the game to disable those effects. This way, newer devices can have all bells and whistles and older devices can still run the game fine. One of the testing devices was a Samsung Galaxy S1 and it went from 5 FPS to 30, which is more then acceptable to play. All 4.0+ devices should have no problem running this, and even if they have they can just disable the option.\nApplication cycle There is a strong possibility the GL view is trashed when the app goes to background, to save resources the view is recreated each time you go back from background to the app. This poses a problem since all gl objects, textures, shaders, VBOs are destroyed too. There is no secure way to ensure the view never gets destroyed while your app is running so I had to make sure each time the view is recreated I re-load all required assets once again. Really not happy with reloading everything again but its the only secure way, if you detect the view was destroyed and the app is still running you have no other choice. For this game it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal, I have few resources and they are fast to load so the user can\u0026rsquo;t even tell. If I had a bigger game with lots of big textures I would probably had to show a loading screen again.\nScreen size The different screen sizes for Android can pose a problem, but you can detect screen density and size and scale your game or take proper actions according to what you have. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can detect it in C++\nint density = AConfiguration_getDensity(engine-\u0026gt;app-\u0026gt;config); int screen_size = AConfiguration_getScreenSize(engine-\u0026gt;app-\u0026gt;config); switch (density) { case ACONFIGURATION_DENSITY_DEFAULT: case ACONFIGURATION_DENSITY_LOW: case ACONFIGURATION_DENSITY_MEDIUM: case ACONFIGURATION_DENSITY_HIGH: break; } switch (screen_size) { case ACONFIGURATION_SCREENSIZE_SMALL: case ACONFIGURATION_SCREENSIZE_NORMAL: case ACONFIGURATION_SCREENSIZE_LARGE: case ACONFIGURATION_SCREENSIZE_XLARGE: break; } You can use screen size to detect if the current device is a tablet or a phone.\nFinal Now that I finished the port it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem that I had to change that much, in fact the game code it self is nearly untouched, just the engine was altered to accommodate for Android. Porting took me ~ 2 months (I have a day job) and while working on a expansion for the game. It\u0026rsquo;s not all chaos in the Android universe, although the hardware fragmentation poses some very serious problems, some devices may be too slow to run even the simpler games.\nIf you have questions about anything else I didn\u0026rsquo;t cover on this article, feel free to ask.\nIn case you are interested in the game, it\u0026rsquo;s out on Steam, App Store and Google Play, feel free to check it out: http://www.questofdungeons.com\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/","summary":"Quest of Dungeons was made in C++ and OpenGL, it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux in native code. iOS is not a problem either since I just have a thin layer of Objective-C to access some functionality like touch, accelerometer, etc and the rest of the code just runs.\nI never made anything for Android, in fact I never even used one before this, so when I decided to port QoD to it, I had no idea of what to expect.","title":"Native game on Android \u0026 Porting Quest of Dungeons"},{"content":"\r(update: 2022- Originally this was under upfallstudios.com/blog, but I moved the whole blog here, while it‚Äôs weird to have a \u0026ldquo;Blog Launch\u0026rdquo; post here, in middle of personal blog, I kept it)\nI would like to welcome everyone to the new blog.\nSo what is Upfall Studios?\nIt‚Äôs an independent game development studio founded by myself in order to develop and distribute games that I make.

But overall I‚Äôm happy with the results so far.\nThe response to the game has been overall positive, and despite a few problems the game has gathered some good reviews.\nTouchArcade ‚Äì 4/5 ‚Äì Review\nCriticalIndieGamer ‚Äì 9/10 ‚Äì Review\nSoftPedia ‚Äì 7/10 ‚Äì Review\n148Apps ‚Äì 4/5 ‚Äì Review\nPocketGamer ‚Äì 6/10 ‚Äì Review\nThere are several youtube videos, and I even caught a few people live streaming it on Twitch, it‚Äôs always awesome to see people playing your game, and having genuine reactions.\nThis is one of my favourite moments (#spoilers)\n{\u0026laquo; youtube ef9Z-Zs23GQ \u0026gt;}}\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2014/04/quest-of-dungeons-is-now-available/","summary":"I‚Äôm pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is finally out.\nI didn‚Äôt get to make a post on day one, and it‚Äôs been nearly two weeks since launch but these past 2 weeks have been one crazy roller coaster.\nIt was released on March 25th, for PC, Mac and iOS.

After a series of interviews I was offered the job and I accepted it. As most of you know I‚Äôve been working in gamedev for most of my professional career. This new job position is not related to game development, but it‚Äôs an excellent opportunity in what I consider a good company. One of the things that got me to accept is the fact that I‚Äôm being thrown out of my comfort zone, which is something that is going to make me have to learn and dig into new technologies, and that is always valuable for a programmer. The fact that I‚Äôll be working with a bigger team is also good, in past jobs teams were smaller and in my gamedev works it‚Äôs usually 1-2 people.\nThey were very cool about letting me do my indie game development on my free time, which is something great, because I intend to keep doing it.

That prevents me for writing boring window handling code for each platform, it just works.\nThese days SDL can be use on almost every platform, Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android. They recently launched the a new version, SDL 2.0 and I was lucky to receive a copy of SDL Game Development written by Shaun Mitchell that covers that new version.\nFor anyone who is starting on game development and wants to use SDL this is a good book, it has simple code and everything is very well explained. But make no mistake, I don‚Äôt recommend this for someone who doesn‚Äôt know code at all, you need to know some C++ to use it, or at least some object oriented language, but chances are, if you are reading my blog you know a OOP language already.\nEverything in the book is explained in a simple way and I don‚Äôt see anyone having any problems, I really liked the code examples, usually some books have a very ‚Äúnon real‚Äù code, stuff that while it works no-one usually does it like that, but this one has stuff that I would do that exact same way. It guides you from making the first hello project to loading an image, a game state machine, getting input from Keyboard, Mouse and Joysticks, a manager to handle textures, and creating a tilemap using Tiled. The Tiled chapter was a positive surprise since not many beginner/intermediate books go much into a data-driven design, and this is very important to make modern games, while it might seem hard to implement for a beginner, trust me it is well worth it.\nNow for things that you might be expecting but are not covered, the book doesn‚Äôt cover any OpenGL/DirectX specifics, so if you are looking for that you won‚Äôt find it here. It is possible to directly call GL/DX instead of using SDL draw calls, this is something I do, but you might lose platform independence if not done properly. Shaders are something also not covered, but then again SDL has no native support for that, you have to do it yourself.\nI also would have liked if the book covered more on configuring SDL on Mac, Linux too, since most people who choose SDL usually do want to build on those platforms.\nTo end this short review, I would say that for everyone that are starting in gamedev, or never used SDL this is a good book, for someone who has already used SDL 2.0 or even 1.2 in the past you probably won‚Äôt find much here that you don‚Äôt already know.\nI was not payed in any form to take a look at this book, nor was this post redacted/altered in any way. I reviewed the book by reading the digital format.

And the advantage of using a more complicated (at first glance) system as a matrix is that you can easily apply more complicated operations like scaling and rotation.\nThe Camera2D class is simple enough:\nclass Camera2d { public: Camera2d(void); virtual ~Camera2d(void);\tinline void\tset_zoom(const float zoom){ _zoom = zoom; } inline float\tget_zoom()const{ return _zoom; }\tMatrix\tget_transformation();\tprotected: void recreate_tranformation_matrix(); protected: // Saves Last Property // This is used for knowing when to update the Matrix struct Transformation { Matrix _matrix; Vector2f _last_pos; float _last_zoom; Vector2f _last_origin; float _last_rotation; void update(const Vector2f\u0026amp; p, const Vector2f\u0026amp; origin, const float zoom, const float rotation) { _last_pos = p; _last_origin = origin; _last_zoom = zoom; _last_rotation = rotation;\t} }; protected: float\t_zoom;\tTransformation _transform; public: Vector2f\t_pos; Vector2f\t_origin; float\t_rotation; }; As the name implies Vector2f and Matrix are the Vector and the Matrix, the full code is included in the project that you can download at the end of the article so I‚Äôm just going to mention the most important parts.\nIn Camera2D class the most important function is the recreate_tranformation_matrix(), get_transformation() just checks if we should recreate it.\nvoid Camera2d::recreate_tranformation_matrix() { // Update Variables _transform.update(_pos,_origin,_zoom,_rotation); _transform._matrix = /* Create our camera matrix, translation to origin, then rotation, scale and finally translation to the camera position */ Matrix::CreateTranslation(-_pos.X,-_pos.Y, 0) * Matrix::CreateScale(_zoom, _zoom, 1)*\tMatrix::CreateRotationZ(_rotation) * Matrix::CreateTranslation(_origin.X,_origin.Y, 0);\t} As you can see we create our finally Matrix considering several things, first there‚Äôs the camera origin or center. This is useful for rotations and scales when you want to keep the camera focusing on a certain element, usually the center. The most common positions will probably be the center of the camera or 0,0.\nNext we have a rotation on Z, next Zoom, this is how much the camera will zoom in or out, again the origin will impact where the zoom center is. Finally the camera position itself. The order of these operations is extremely important since mat1*mat2 != mat2*mat1.\nSo how could you use this?\nFirst the camera setup\n// Create our new camera Camera2d* camera = new Camera2d(); camera-\u0026gt;_origin.set(width/2.0f, height/2.0f); // width and height are the screen sizes, so we can focus on the center camera-\u0026gt;pos.set(250.0f,100.0f); camera-\u0026gt;set_zoom(2.0f); Now to actually draw.\nglMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glPushMatrix(); glLoadIdentity();\t// Get our transformation matrix Matrix mat = camera-\u0026gt;get_transformation(); // Convert it to a float 16 float m[16]; mat.to_mat4(m); /* Send matrix to opengl*/ glMultMatrixf(m); // Draw anything we want This code can be optimized in many ways, but the idea here is to be simple enough to understand, that is the most important.\nDownload: OpenGLCamera2D.rar\nThis is a VS 2010 project using GLFW for window creation.

I always used Feedburner to redirect feeds, and with Google Reader going down I decided to start switching, so in your new FeedsReader use this address: (\u0026lt;/feed/\u0026gt;). I didn‚Äôt deactivated the old one, so they will work both for now (if I didn‚Äôt broke anything). Also, give Feedly a try in case you haven‚Äôt found a replacement for Reader.\nSo what‚Äôs been happening? I‚Äôll try to compress here a bunch of things that I‚Äôve been doing, if you want to know.\nPuwang new update\nIf you follow my twitter you may already know this, but I released a new update with two new game modes (yes, free, no IAP‚Äôs). A Hard and Survivor mode, which is pretty much self-explanatory, the Hard mode has more enemies and they spawn anywhere on the screen. Survivor mode is the same as normal but your ship won‚Äôt evolve, making it harder to survive.\nI did these two modes mainly because while it can can be fun to pick up the game once in a while, once you get used to the controls anytime I played it I was like ‚ÄúGod, I wish the faster action started faster‚Äù, because the game gets incrementally harder to play, but it starts out pretty easy. This was also something many told me personally or via twitter, so I decided to make it.\nNew modes have their own separate Leaderboards too.\nThere‚Äôs an extra feature I‚Äôm considering for Puwang, but for a later time, which is recording the game, so you can share it via Twitter, Facebook, etc. I think it might be a nice addition, but it will take some time, whenever I decide to start working on it anyway. It‚Äôs just something on my head.\nThere‚Äôs one extra improvement, which is the rendering pipeline was written to be faster, so less battery usage, check Dary‚Äôs Legend below for more info.\niTunes link\nDary‚Äôs Legend\nThis has been my main project for a long time now, I‚Äôve been making posts about it on the game page itself, felt a bit weird to replicated them here, because I assume if anyone is interesting in knowing about the game they will probably check the official places anyway.\nBut related to development I might say I made some considerable improvements on the rendering pipeline, gained 10FPS in debug mode, while the game runs at 60FPS in release I always had low FPS in debug, since my pc is old, around 20-25FPS. After the changes I get 30-35FPS).\nI achieved this tweaking two sections. First I cached a bunch of calculations on my Sprite class, most of they where done in each draw, which was stupid since most of the time I only needed them to be done when an image change occurs or a scale.\nThe other tweak was using glDrawElements instead of glDrawArrays and sending vertex data with indices. I‚Äôm not entirely sure this will lead to immediate FPS improvement but at least less data is send to GPU.\nSo for a quad I use GL_TRIANGLES with 4 points. Now has you know GL_TRIANGLES required 3 points per triangle, so since a Quad is two triangle this would required 6 points. So I send the 4 points with 6 indices instead. This proved particularly good for iOS devices. Much less GPU usage, which leads to a smoother game and less battery usage.\nI pushed both this improvements to Puwang too.\nRight now I have the next update almost finished, it‚Äôs just missing art, so it‚Äôs on the artist‚Äôs hands now, I‚Äôm already working on the next feature which are Pets.\nDL Official site\nNew layout\nIf you are reading this from a feed disregard the rest of this section. As you may noticed the site has a new layout, I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs better or worst, for now I like it. The older one had too much stuff going around, this is a bit cleaner. I‚Äôm a fan of darker themes, but it‚Äôs hard to find good ones, well, for free at least. I payed for some in the past, but the problem is as time goes by and WordPress updates they start breaking everywhere. Hope you like it, leave comments if you don‚Äôt.\nBack pain\nSo as any programmer we eventually develop some back pain due to the very long hours we are forced to work in front of computers. I started having this occasional really intense pain for little more than a year. Not frequent, like every 2 months, lasted only like 2-3 days but to the point where I could barely walk. Of course I went to a doctor, ‚ÄúDrink more water he said, that‚Äôs just kidneys‚Äù. It made some sense so I decided to drink even more water, I usually keep a bottle near the computer I already drink some, but decided to drink even more. Around 3 weeks ago I had to take a 3-4 hour bus trip, the pain kicked in again, bad. Someone recommended me going to one of those guys that check your bones, if everything is ok, really don‚Äôt know the name since it‚Äôs not an official job. I went there, the guy told me I had a rib making pressure into my right kidney. He did his thing and I felt immediate relief, like magic really, of course it was only momentarily, but after that I only felt discomfort of him pulling the rib to the right place. I honestly felt bad for not having more money with me at the time, he didn‚Äôt even want any, but I gave him anyway. He told me this doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm cured, I still have to control the amount of hours I spend on the computer, drink water, exercise, the usually actually, and wait and see if the really intense pain comes back. I have my movements a bit restricted now since I have to be careful for some weeks to make sure the rib doesn‚Äôt get in the way again. I feel some discomfort in that area sometimes but nothing compared to the pain it was before, and only in a couple of months will I know if it actually helped in the long run. But for now it‚Äôs much better, I‚Äôve been able to work, I just can‚Äôt lift anything heavy for now.\nStill here?\nI‚Äôve been playing some games but I‚Äôll leave that to another separate post. Maybe two posts on the same day?

If you follow my blog you probably already know that between small projects like Puwang and other mandatory freelancing stuff my big project in hands for these past few months is Dary‚Äôs Legend, a roguelike.\nAround two months ago I coincidentally bumped into a conversation about funding and the whole kickstarter thing where one of Desura staff members was participating, and while talking about my own problems funding a whole game out of my pocket he mentioned that he knew the game and that Desura‚Äôs Alpha Funding might be a good place for it.\nSo yesterday we released it, and you can buy the game right now, get an alpha build with a nice discount while it doesn‚Äôt reach the final build and help us funding the development along the way.\nThe build is relatively stable, no major crashes crashes that we know and there‚Äôs a Windows and Mac build.\nCoder-Side-Notes\nPersonally, and although I‚Äôm happy that I managed to get a Windows and Mac build released side-by-side I‚Äôm also a bit sad that I haven‚Äôt been able to release it simultaneously for Linux as well.\nInitially my thought was, ‚ÄúWindows only till the final release, I‚Äôll deal with ports later‚Äù. But the market is harsh and getting into 2 different platforms can get you more chances of selling.\nThere wasn‚Äôt a Mac build until a month ago, but I decided to take a couple of days, created a Xcode project and build the source.\nAfter a few tweaks and hacks I had it running, why not release it? So right now, by using Git, since projects are already configured on Windows and Mac, I just need to commit changes, boot the other machine, build and that‚Äôs it.\nLinux is a little trickier, first I have little experience with that OS. Second I never had my engine running there, missing all kind of abstraction layers, directory access, mouse, keyboard, etc. And honestly right now I don‚Äôt have the time to be handling 3 versions at the same time. So Linux is probably going to be off the table until the final build is done.\nOh, another thing is that, after getting it running on Mac, I tried building for iPad, the game runs almost perfectly at 60FPS @1024√ó768, apart from the interface not being prepared for Touch of course, it was designer for a 2 button mouse. So there might be an iPad eventually.\nThis whole process has made me consider if I should‚Äôt find an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù (cause VS is the best) cross-platform IDE, like Eclipse or so. Configuring a project on Visual Studio, than on Xcode and another one on Linux (whatever I might end using) is an nightmare. On the other hand I could also take a plunge into makefiles with CMake‚Ä¶guess I‚Äôll leave that to another project.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2012/12/darys-legend-alpha-released/","summary":"Yay, so a milestone was reached with this project.

Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt had that code we where using back then so I had to do some digging on the internet.\nSo after a few days I had it working but bumped into the same problem, a bit slow. Not as slow as before cause computers have evolved. But after some reading I discovered that you can actually cache some YUV-\u0026gt;RBG values and speed went up by like 10 fold.\nI can decode 1080p videos with audio on my Core2Duo @ 2 GHz. And I mention the core since I have the decoding from the file on a separated thread so on a single core it‚Äôs probably a bit slower.\nBut we probably will be placing videos around 512px width so there‚Äôs no problem there. I wonder if we could do the YUV-\u0026gt;RGBA on the GPU side via a shader?\nIt‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I‚Äôm using OpenGL and ‚ÄúglTexSubImage2D‚Äù for updating the texture. I found out that it‚Äôs much faster than ‚ÄúglTexImage2D‚Äù because it respecifies the entire texture, changing its size, deleting the previous data, and so forth. ‚ÄúglTexSubImage2D‚Äù only modifies pixel data within the texture.\nTools\nOn the tools realm there was a need for a better Particle System Editor, the one we had has many things but adding stuff was turning into a nightmare, the old editor was build on XNA 3.1 which isn‚Äôt supported by VS2010.\nSince the engine is already in C++ I started from scratch and built this handy tool in 3 days or so:\nNot vary fancy but it gets the job done.\nMy next step was to fix most of the Sprite Sheet Editor bugs and issues my designer had been complaining about.\nI already have an offline tool that grabs a bunch of tiny images and place them in an Atlas but most of the time the designer has the pieces together already on Photoshop so I incorporated a snippet of code that on double clicking an area tries to automatically detect the region around it. Anything that fails can be manually defined, the old fashioned way.\nSo in the next few days I‚Äôm working on the Animation Editor so the artist can quickly create and preview the animations from the sprite sheets without the need for me to place them in the game before hand.\nI had most of these tools but they where awful.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing a heavily graphic game but I like to know that It can be used even on slower pcs and that I‚Äôm not using more cycles than necessary.\nThis past week and after reading a bunch of stuff and keynotes from John Carmack about Rage (60FPS ftw) I decided to measure my own stuff.\nSo let‚Äôs break this down, your framerate or FPS is the number of images you draw per second, not just that, you have to animate stuff, play sound, collisions, etc.\nMost 3D games nowadays target 30 FPS, it‚Äôs the minimum acceptable before you start noticing slowdowns or not so smooth animations, for 2D games it‚Äôs a pretty realistic objective to target 60FPS.\nLet say you want to target 30 FPS,\n1 second = 1000 milliseconds 1000/30 = ~33.3 milliseconds That means that for 30 FPS you have to calculate, animate, do collision and draw the scene in under 33.3 milliseconds. And do it again 30 more times.\nSounds hard doesn‚Äôt it?\nAt 60 FPS it‚Äôs even worse\n1000/60 = ~16.6 milliseconds 16.6 milliseconds to do a full loop on your engine. Actually with modern technology it‚Äôs not an impressive accomplishment depending on what you are doing but it‚Äôs a good practice to\nlook at these numbers, consider them while you code.\nNow I‚Äôve been making some tests on my own engine and I placed 2000 sprites each with a sprite animation and an A* pathfinding (2000 paths can be cached at a time) rendering at 100 FPS.\nIt runs well and each loops takes 9ms.\n1000/100 = 10ms Each loop could take up to 10ms, so I‚Äôm wasting 1ms for each loop, bringing the sum up to 100ms per second.\nWhen I say waste it doesn‚Äôt mean you could be doing something else but you could make you game a bit more CPU friendly make making it sleep that extra millisecond each cycle.\nThis will actually make you game use less of a processor and you can even check it on the Windows Task Manager.\nAt just 60 FPS, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm drawing everything at 9ms too, but I could take up to 16.6\n16 - 9 = 7ms 7 * 60 (FPS) = 420ms You can make your application sleep for almost half of a second and the game would run exactly the same\nIsn‚Äôt that something?\nI‚Äôve made a change on my pump to accommodate this and tested on Vizati, now most of the time it uses 12% of the CPU with bursts of 32%.\nOf course by measuring this you can also do cooler stuff like, let‚Äôs say you walk by a heavy area, or need to do some calculations, by lowering the intended FPS and drawing less times in that second you can get the other calculations done faster and return to a normal FPS much faster.\nWell I hope this wasn‚Äôt too boring =)\nEDIT:\nAfter talking to some other devs there are mixed feelings about the benefits of putting your application to sleep those extra milliseconds. One thing that‚Äôs worth mentioning is that when you put your application to sleep you only guarantee that it will be idle for a minimum of let‚Äôs say 5ms, you may only regain control after 7ms, that‚Äôs really up to the OS.\nSo my suggestion is, leave it as an option in the game, CPU throttling or something. Each user may test and see if it benefits, and in a couple of years it may in fact make some difference with to futuristic 30 core cpu where you don‚Äôt need to be using 100% of it.

Actually it‚Äôs just the 9th.\nI hope my words have somehow enriched your knowledge, in case you want to stick around just bookmark my feeds. I keep this fairly updated. Also since I‚Äôve been working on a new game\nthere‚Äôs probably news to share in the next 2-3 months.\nAround 11 months ago I registered my App Store developer account. The idea‚Ä¶put Vizati on the iPhone.\nI‚Äôve never worked with Mac‚Äôs before, didn‚Äôt even have an iPhone/iPod or whatever. I just read that a bunch of people got rich and many more where making a living out of it.\nSo here I go.\nJust placing an app there will sell\nMy first BIG mistake was the general conception that ‚Äújust placing an app there will sell‚Äù. That‚Äôs probably true on the very first months the App Store opened. Not now, trust me. You release a new game, will probably have a few sales on the 1st day because it‚Äôs on the new released games and that‚Äôs it, only on very rare conditions will the game start selling very good with just that.\nSo keep in mind advertisement on iOS is mandatory, forums, twitter, mailing list, whatever.\nThe first month I was sending dozens of emails every single day to websites, journalists, magazines, some paid off, others didn‚Äôt.\nRelease my app at a Thursday to be featured at that week‚Äôs App Featured Apps\nAlthough this might increase your odds, we released Vizati on a Friday, 2 weeks later it got a feature on the App Store, so it can still happen. Just create something cool and appealing.\n$0.99 is the way to go\nWrong, don‚Äôt EVER place your app at $0.99 right from start. Evaluate it well, start higher. Having a higher price will help to distinguish it from others, will give you margin for promotions without making it free. Many costumers, tired of the enormous lists of game will only seek higher priced games because logic mandates that they are indeed better. If you think your app is not worth more that $0.99 go back to the drawing boards. There‚Äôs no sense in having crappy apps, 100 bad apps may not sell as much as 5 really good ones.\nSelling at a low price will also bring all kinds of customers, they will give you a 1 star just because you haven‚Äôt updated the app in 5 months or so. Customers that buy pricier app are more forgiving and respectful.\nMaking a Free promotion will help boost sales afterwords\nTrue, for the first 2-3 days. Then you‚Äôll get back to whatever you where selling. Unless you have some in-game purchases it‚Äôs not worth it. Well only if you want to brag to your friends that your app got 100K downloads no matter the price. I‚Äôve tried this 3 times, each time I place it at a smarter occasion getting successfully more downloads, thing is that after 3 days of getting back to regular price things would slowly return to normal. Depending on promotion amount of days you may end up with the same money you would have not making the promotion. Also usually you will see your rating decreasing half or a full star, keep in mind, all kinds of people will download it.\nAnswering to customers Feedback helps sales\nObviously implementing a highly demanded features will make them happy thus recommending to friends. Just don‚Äôt go making all the changes they ask. Choose a position and defend it, show that things are the way they are because you choose so, not because of some mistake.\nPeople will buy all kinds of crap, just place one level.\nAlso true, but just because they bought a ‚Äúfart app‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they wont‚Äô complain about your 15m duration game.\nWell, time to go work on top secret project, see ya later\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2011/06/so-what-have-i-learned-after-eight-months-on-the-app-store/","summary":"First of all I think this is my last idevblogaday post for a while.

That state of mind where you are immersed into the project, no distractions. It can happen after half an hour or 2hours, but it‚Äôs usually very difficult to start right away. Steve Streeting has some interesting thoughts and tips on this.\nYou just got back from work, you‚Äôre tired, you have like 2-3 hours of spare time for coding. It gives time for doing a lot of work, the problem is that you‚Äôll probably waste the first half wondering where you left, what algorithm where you working, trying to get back to that line of thinking from the previous day.\nI waste a lot of time too but I‚Äôve realized that leaving functions unfinished but with comments on how to write the rest helps out for the next day. You just have to convert that pseudo code into actual code, after a bit all starts to came back to you.\nMaking some notes on a notebook also helps, everything you think helps out catching up. Because most of the time when you need to stop is when you are really making progress.\nBalancing a social life with this is hard, if you are really serious about finishing a game you‚Äôll probably need to be doing this for several months, or even years, it‚Äôs too much time to be cooked at home. Don‚Äôt forget there‚Äôs life outside, discuss your projects with close friends, have them play and you‚Äôll get feedback. Because if the project sinks you‚Äôll loose much more. Also it‚Äôs a great way to have ideas. I never once had any good idea just by standing in front of the computer. Go watch some movies, read books. If you are working on the game with a partner drag him/her to the street with laptops. Working always at home isn‚Äôt that fun.\nGet a job that won‚Äôt cut your wings but isn‚Äôt the typical ‚Äúburger flipping‚Äù isn‚Äôt easy. If you end up working on IT or worse on a game company make sure not to jeopardize your game and job, most employers don‚Äôt like the idea that you are working on stuff of your own. They will tell you something like ‚ÄúYou are a liability‚Ä¶ because you would rather be doing something else‚Äù. So keep your head straight. If you don‚Äôt like the job, get another one, don‚Äôt hang on to it because you think you‚Äôll be rich in a couple of months. You make have to stick with it for another whole project development before the indie thing takes off. Oh and get something that actually pay the bills in full, so if you start making some side money you can start saving.\nQuitting work to stay home working on your game for a couple of months is also a viable option, but make sure you have savings for around 7 months and get back to work after 4. You‚Äôll never know how hard it will be to get another job. It‚Äôs not an ideal system but I know people who make it work.\nWorking as freelancer is something else you can do, but from personal experience is too inconsistent, at least where I live. You can earn in a month money to support you for 3 months but then stay a bunch of time without getting anything to do. Good web development skills is handy, there‚Äôs always people looking for a website to be done.\nI know this wasn‚Äôt the #idevblogaday post you guys were expecting but there you have.\nEDIT (16/05/2011): This article showed up at Gamasutra front page as a featured post, so a lot of cool comments and other tips are showing up there, check it out\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2011/05/indie-and-day-job-making-it-work/","summary":"A large percentage of the indie developers have to work on their project at night and/or weekends.\nIn order to pay the bills they have to maintain a day job.

Now, note that this is a personal problem of mine since most people can still play hours and hours of those games even though they have dozens of them, but I‚Äôm pretty sure more feel the same.\nUsually the games I play longer and have more fun with are the ones I buy via PC, either mainstream like Portal 2 or indie games like Super Meat Boy, why? Not because they are better or worse games, but because I spent ‚Ç¨30 on Portal 2 and ‚Ç¨10 on Super Meat Boy. Play them for a couple of weeks and felt rewarded. The feeling was even better back when I was a kid, it was way hard to buy those SNES cartridges but when enough money was gathered I played them for months.\nSo what makes me feel more compelled to play these games? Probably the fact that I had to hand picked them since I‚Äôm not swimming in money. I had to work hard for that money, decided to spend it on some digital entertainment and got rewarded, that is all part of the process. Games are supposed to entertain you and give you a sense of achievement. I think now days they replaced that with actual ‚ÄúAchievements‚Äù and ‚ÄúGamerScore‚Äù‚Äòs\nAs a developer\nApplying the same rules as above, people have access to way too many games, and they feel like for $0.99 they have the right to a 10+ hours game, monthly updates with new free content so they feel compelled to play your game.

But they don‚Äôt see it that way.\nSurviving in that ecosystem is hard and although you may (on a long shot of pure luck) make a couple of millions, for me it‚Äôs sad to sell this kind of software this cheap.\nTake a look at this example.

I don‚Äôt have any experience with them so until I have some complaint I won‚Äôt make any waves.\nFinal note\nI‚Äôve been receiving some (well maybe a lot) of emails inquiring about my little baby engine Basalt.\nWhere‚Äôs some of the questions I‚Äôve been getting.\nQ: Why did you do it, there‚Äôs stuff like Unity, Unreal, XNA, Cocos2d, etc.\nA: I started to do it on a need-basis and it slowly evolved into what it is today. I started working on it on December 2009. It‚Äôs not a day to night work. This also allowed me to have much more control on porting.\nQ: Will you release the source code?\nA: At the moment there‚Äôs no plans to release it either in open source, paid or binary mode. Why? Because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ready for any of them. There‚Äôs tons of hacked lines, tons of //todo, stuff I haven‚Äôt tested, others I know that don‚Äôt work but haven‚Äôt got the time, etc etc.\nWhile I‚Äôve considered to sell/release it I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ready and honestly at this point there are far better solutions out there.\nQ: Can I get access to the source to help you improving the engine?\nA: Sorry, no, see previous answer.\nQ: Is it genre oriented like Source is oriented for FPS?\nA: Not a chance, at this point I can pretty much do anything I want, at least in 2D. The genre-oriented is usually part of the game code.\nQ: How did you make that editor on those youtube videos? #1 #2\nA: It‚Äôs called Sapphire and I used C#/ XNA 3.1 with Neoforce Controls (discontinued). I‚Äôm going to port it to C++ eventually. Probably cross-platform.\nQ: Why only 2D?\nA: Because I haven‚Äôt made any 3D game.\nQ: You still haven‚Äôt answered my question\nA: Are you sure?\nBtw, tomorrow is my turn to make an article for http://idevblogaday.com/, let me know if you have any iOS related stuff you want me to talk about it and I‚Äôll consider it.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2011/04/starlog-14042011/","summary":"Hum‚Ä¶some stuff happened lately, some I can‚Äôt go into detail right now others I can.\nI was talking with Rita the other days and she had this nice idea for an iPhone game.\nIt‚Äôs one of those small concepts that may or not work but I liked the general idea, at least enough to start a small prototype.

Even though I only have one product on the App Store I have gathered some knowledge on how stuff works to get there.\nI‚Äôll start by talking a bit about how we made our PC game Vizati to iPhone.\rWhen we started, this represented our chance of making games and putting ourselves into test. Without any pre determined rules and/or a major company dictating what to do we were able to have full creative control to try and do something a bit different.\nVizati is a casual puzzle game with a story as a background. The game is now available for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad and Windows Phone 7. Developed by only two people, it thankfully received several good reviews.\nLaunching for Windows\nWe started out building for Windows and Xbox360 because it was a very well known platform for us; we had tools and knowledge from other games so it felt right.\nWe launched the game on June 6th; and got some very positive reviews, being its freshness, graphics and music the most acclaimed features.\nRight away we started making plans for bringing the game to iOS devices, iPhone, iPad etc. The mobile devices felt like a great platform for such a game.\nFirst speed bump\nFor the PC we had built the game engine using XNA framework as a base, it is DirectX based but it uses .Net languages which are a no go for iOS devices of course. It was stable enough to ensure a high compatibility with all the different machines out there, and we never thought at start to make it for any other platforms. This was our first mistake.\nFor the next 3 months I had to rewrite all the game codebase to C++ including building the engine itself using render API OpenGLES. [Dedicated Post]\nDuring these 3 months we also had to adjust the game to the iPhone screen size. Just out of curiosity the native resolution on PC is HD, 1280√ó720 and the iPhone native is 640√ó426. [See more on iOS hardware]\nAt first we considered using the same images and using the same feature we used on PC to automatically scale the game to the screen size. But doing that would be a tremendous effort to the device since the iPhone screen size was almost 3 times smaller; memory and CPU cycles are more limited in mobiles so we had to make a smarter approach.\nOne of the problems was the game being extremely slow on older devices. The amount of particles and animations on some parts was a total killer. I eventually had to rewrite my primitive drawing code to batch stuff as much as possible\nAnother problem was the aspect ratio, which would lead to either stretching the game vertically thus distorting the images or making it letterboxed.\nThe screen is already small so it would be a mistake not to take advantage of all the area. Rita had to redo some of the art to fit a different aspect ratio.\nFortunately touch felt a very natural way for controlling the game, even more than a keyboard. Using the fingers to rotate, shake and flip the cube feels right and natural.\nThe iPad version was easy once we had the iPhone version made, basically we just had to bundle high-resolution images since its screen resolution is 1024√ó768. This version features the HD graphics that so many loved in the PC version.\nMost recently the hard work I did doing a somewhat multi-platform engine payed off and we released it for Mac on the App Store with around just 4 days of extra work.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2011/03/bringing-a-game-from-pc-to-ios/","summary":"This is my first post to http://idevblogaday.com/, I‚Äôve been waiting since November so I‚Äôm pretty excited about writing to a broader audience =P.

Also what I‚Äôve realized is that I don‚Äôt spend enough time testing the game, oh and you too, yes YOU (I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a developer of course).\nThe past year I gather around a few friends who never played it to test the game for 2 days. 6 people played it the first day, 4 played it on the second day. We gathered around all complaints and issues and addressed them. After that there was more play-testing but not as aggressive. There were 3 or 4 persons testing it regularly.\nThe problem was always that the game was running on a more or less safe environment, there are tons and tons of different PC configurations out there. Installations problem, bad drivers, some other software running causing conflicts, all this can happen.\nPC The PC version most problematic issue was getting everything installed properly. .NET framework installation would sometimes fail and silently quit and for all purposes the game was supposed to run.\nIt never happened to any of our testers, but as soon as the game went out it happened.\nI accidentally bumped into a thread while searching for Vizati reviews and found a client complaining that he just bought the game, It wouldn‚Äôt even start and that the developers didn‚Äôt even care.\nI was shocked‚Ä¶what? I checked my inbox, both my personal and Different Pixel inbox. Nothing, I sent a email for myself from an external account to test it since we are running our pop server on a rented one. It worked. I decided to register an account on that forum and contact the player.\nAfter a few email exchanges we figured out what it was and I created a thread on our own forum (dead link).\nThe reason he said the developers wouldn‚Äôt care is cause he wrongly assumed we wouldn‚Äôt based on past experiences with other games. This is a very problematic issue, having around a client telling that you just care about selling is bad if you are just starting. There‚Äôs not much you can do with people who don‚Äôt even try and make contact.\nXbox360 This version is perfect, there isn‚Äôt a single bug and I dare someone to point one‚Ä¶.\nlol actually the Xbox360 version never went for sale, still waiting for that XBLIG on Portugal\niOS That‚Äôs the main issue with the iPhone port, I never gotten a single email.\nI know a small percentage had some issues, it‚Äôs inevitable, but they rather place a 1 star rating and a ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt work‚Äù comment and move along. With all the updates some eventually place another comment like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working now‚Äù. But I‚Äôm still in the dark, what is working that wasn‚Äôt before? Is it something I fix intentionally or accidentally?\nAlthough the iPhone is a more controlled environment you can still have issues. You have 4 generations of iPhone, 4 generations of iPod Touch and iPad. Different memories, different CPU speeds. Also some have OpenGL 1 others OpenGL2. Also some run on an ARM6 others on ARM7, the processor type is transparent for the developer but if you know what you are using you can optimize floating point calculations a bunch.\nI tested the game on an iPod Touch 2G, had a couple of testers playing on iPhone and half-way through I found out that game was almost unplayable on a 1st Gen iPhone. I solve that optimizing the engine.\nThis proves that without those external testers I would have placed the game for sell just like that without even knowing there was a problem. My iPod Touch is one of the slowest so I assumed it was ok. Don‚Äôt assume anything.\nWP7 The WP7 port has this one bug that has been haunting me and I can‚Äôt reproduce it. Basically the tutorial font get‚Äôs all twisted but only when viewing the tutorial. Someone reported it to me and I wasn‚Äôt able to reproduce it on the emulator. After I got a real device I can‚Äôt make it happen, No one has given feedback about that on Vizati ratings at the WP7 Marketplace. Rita also has another WP7 device it it works great too.\nA couple weeks ago I was invited to present the game at a conference, they had the game installed on one of the other speakers phone and it was working. Suddenly during the presentation to the audience it happened, I quickly skipped the tutorial and the game continued normally. So this one is still out there. Other than that I had 2 persons complaining that the game would crash after starting but a soft reset did the trick.\nMac Around a week ago we‚Äôve released Vizati for Mac on the App Store. This raises a bunch of more potential problems, some Macs have PPC, others Intel Processors. Also I never, ever coded anything for Mac, it‚Äôs always scary‚Ä¶ even more since I don‚Äôt have a couple of macs laying around to test, I have to rely on remote testers.\nI haven‚Äôt gotten many emails, most are suggestions or so and so far the worst bug report I got was the game not running in fullscreen, only in Window Mode, which I assume is the game wrongly calculating the screen max resolution. When toggling to fullscreen I‚Äôm querying the screen current size and using it so there may be some issues there. Must address that.\nA BIG mistake I did with the Mac version was forgetting to activate the File Logger. Stupid stupid stupid. I did that to help me track where the issues may be and I totally forgot to activate it on the final build üôÅ\nWord of advice: When pushing a new patched version make sure you didn‚Äôt introduced a new bug.\nIt happens‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶ a lot‚Ä¶.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2011/02/playtesting-and-tech-support-the-other-side-of-the-coin/","summary":"Something that has always been scary (well, it‚Äô still is) before launching Vizati is tech support.\nNo matter how much you tested your game, it‚Äôs bound to have bugs.

XBLIG is now on the ‚ÄúSpeciality Shops‚Äù, right next to Avatar Marketplace, not even worthy of being the Games section. Even if you search a XBLIG game there it won‚Äôt return any result.\nSince XBLIG is on the second tab most people will see Avatar and scroll down or up, it took me a couple minutes tracking it down and I was searching everywhere, so odds of someone seeing XBLIG are way lower, even lower to find your game, not to mention actually buying it.\nA couple reports and developers are saying that sales dropped around 80%, going from around 100 to 18 copies/day for some.\nI can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised, with the launch of Windows Phone 7, the deletion of Creator‚Äôs Club just to merge us with WP7 devs in App Hub, it was obvious XBLIG devs would lose focus and attention.\nLet‚Äôs recap, XNA gained momentum purely on XBLIG because there just a few titles for PC using XNA framework and most of them are Ports, and now they are turning their backs on the ones who proved XNA could have some future. Sure many devs can jump right into the WP7 without relearning anything else, but most of them grabbed XNA not only for the money but for being able to develop to they console, how cool is that right? Honestly I prefer developing for PC or Xbox360 or any TV-plugged console than any mobile device.\nWhy? Well, mobile games are expected to be packed with features, updated regularly and priced and 0.99. This is depressing for most devs, not being able to put the price they think their game is worth. Also people expect their 0.99 game to last hours and will bitch about everything. The PC indie scene is a little more gentile and filled with indie-scene lovers, also games can generally be placed up till $20 which is more worthy of your 1 year development effort right?\nIt‚Äôs not that I hate mobiles but it‚Äôs a very different market to handle and not everyone will like it.\nI hope they come around and give a little more attention to this, maybe someone just screwed up with the tabs and all will be fixed soon.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/11/my-2-cents-on-xblig-current-state/","summary":"UPDATE: Pressure works, Microsoft backs down over XBLIG changes: http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a286779/microsoft-backs-down-over-xblig-changes.html\nLet me start by saying that this is just a personal opinion, nothing more, nothing less.\nIt was with great sadness that I saw what the latest update to the Xbox360 dashboard did to Xbox Indie Games\nSee?

If, at any point, a segment of the path being traversed has a higher cost than another encountered path segment, it abandons the higher-cost path segment and traverses the lower-cost path segment instead. This process continues until the goal is reached.\nThe major choke point is the heuristic used to calculate which node to take next. I‚Äôve started by using Manhattan Distance.\nIts primary advantage is that it will generally get you to the target faster than most alternatives. Its primary drawback is that in a 8-way pathfinder so it is not guaranteed to give us the shortest possible path.\nfloat cost = 10*(abs(currentX-targetX) + abs(currentY-targetY)) Although it works fast it‚Äôs not accurate and if I forced for finding the shortest possible it was rather slow for my 80√ó44 grid (3520 tiles), sometimes taking 3-4 seconds to find a path.\nI decided to take another approach and using Diagonal Shortcut, its primary advantage is that, because it is balanced, it is able to fully consider small modifiers like a turning penalty or influence map modifier like having a non walkable tile, a rock, a tree, whatever. It is a bit slower than the Manhattan method, though.\nfloat cost; float xDistance = abs(currentX-targetX) float yDistance = abs(currentY-targetY) if (xDistance \u0026gt; yDistance) cost = 14*yDistance + 10*(xDistance-yDistance) else cost = 14*xDistance + 10*(yDistance-xDistance) In case you are wondering the 10 and the 14 are to define if it‚Äôs a diagonal or a horizontal/vertical movement since diagonals take longer to traverse than straight lines of course.\nAfter I‚Äôm getting much faster movements.\nIt‚Äôs not that Manhattan is worse and you shouldn‚Äôt use it, it all depends on the application your using.\n* On a square grid that allows 4 directions of movement, use Manhattan distance.\n* On a square grid that allows 8 directions of movement, use Diagonal distance.\nThis is a video I‚Äôve done using Manhattan distance using tile grids generated from a black and white image.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/10/a-pathfinding/","summary":"For my current project I‚Äôve been working with A* as a path-finding solution.\nBasically it‚Äôs a way to get from point A to point B.\nThis is used for AI in games mostly on tiled based games, It‚Äôs very simple to understand and implement.\nAs A* traverses the graph, it follows a path of the lowest known cost, keeping a sorted priority queue of alternate path segments along the way.

Most games today are just graphics graphics, I use super shader ray-traced lights but I forgot gameplay because I‚Äôm a tech demo.\nI grew up with a Super Nintendo playing Super Mario World and Zelda A Link to the Past, yeah shocker, no Spectrum to me :P, so I‚Äôm 2D gameplay type lover.\nI always loved Mario games, the precision and the rush of making a level without stopping or speeding down was as good as it gets for platform games in my opinion. This is the key point in Mario games, not the story, why else would people still be playing those games? The princess keeps being kidnapped by the same dude, there‚Äôs basically no story so what keeps gamers coming around is gameplay and fun.\nThis is what Super Meat Boy brings us, excellent gameplay with all the frustration and deaths that actually brings meaning to reaching the end of a level. I‚Äôve been following Meat Boy development ever since it was announced, well in fact I‚Äôm an avid Edmund Mcmillen fan even since Gish, I even bought his ‚ÄúThis is a cry for help‚Äù cd, comes packed with 18 games and great comics, you should get it if we is still selling them.\nSorry Tommy Refenes but I don‚Äôt know any of your past works. Anyway, back on track‚Ä¶\nThe game is a fast paced platform game with a block of meat which mission is to reach Bandage Girl (it‚Äôs Super Meat Boy ‚Äúprincess peach‚Äù) on every level, for that we must jump, jump, jump, avoid traps, jump, did I mention we has to jump?\nThe entire game is about precision and button timing, you fail you die, too slow? goodbye.\nThis will put you swearing at the TV like you never did, believe me, and not because the buttons feel dumb or the game didn‚Äôt respond but because you sucked and died. The controls are so well responsive that it feels like they grabbed Super Mario controls code and improved it.\nPlus the Xbox360 controller buttons colors are almost the same as the SNES controller, I felt like going back in time.\nA curious thing is, there‚Äôs a run button, the X and another for jump, the A button. Most of the time you will be running so the run button feels almost useless. Well the obvious thing is, on tight platforms you won‚Äôt be running, the other thing is this was the first time since those early hardcore platform games which I felt that pressing that button all the time helped me grasping the controller better, and jump seem more timed because you are using the same finger to press them both. Just try it, you‚Äôll see what I mean.\nGraphically the game is simple but pretty with small details that you‚Äôll probably miss the first time you play each level. My only complaint is that the cutscenes don‚Äôt feel like they belong in the game, because the lack of detail in scenarios and characters, luckily most will put a smile on your face so no harm done.\nThe game is packed with unlockable characters from other indie games like Beat Trip, Braid, Gish, you name it. For that you need to collect bandages all across the levels. The other things is that each level has a Light and Dark World, (Zelda Link to the Past memories for me) and you unlock the Dark World, which is even harder when you score an A in the Light World.\nSo the game is a blast and I highly recommend it, even more because right now is at 800 MS Points.\nHere‚Äôs a video of me playing, be warned I‚Äôm not a very good player üòõ\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/10/super-meat-boy-meat-dissection/","summary":"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews about games, maybe mostly because I don‚Äôt play as often as I used to.

Took me too long to port Vizati from C# to C++ and then having to implement an OpenGL render layer. If I had an C++/DirectX engine from the start it would be a question of replacing the rendering stuff to OpenGL. Or maybe just using OpenGL for Windows as-well.\nIf it was up to me I would use XNA everywhere, I love it and it‚Äôs a great framework once you get the hang of it but it‚Äôs downside is being restricted to Microsoft platforms. With nowadays platforms and a bunch of market to tackle you can see many indie pc games coming to iPhone too, like Osmos and Eufloria. Many games make sense on mobiles, many don‚Äôt.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve leaned with all this process is that you‚Äôll never know when you need your code to run somewhere else that originally intended and for that C++ is generally the way to go. I got so used to C# Reflection, instanced based objects and lambda expressions that when I got to porting that part I was ready to pull my hair off. Lucky there‚Äôs many turn around you can do.\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean C# is worse or better than C++. They are different, and if you want to reuse code check their differences. One word of advice, don‚Äôt use foreach, for(;;) is nice and you‚Äôll have many less lines to change.\nNew Projects With Vizati almost wrapped up I want to move on to other projects and leaving Vizati on a support/bug fix state only.\nI really don‚Äôt know if we will manage to finance another game, It‚Äôs a bit dependent on the success on the iPhone/WP7 port.\nApart from financial problems deciding on a new project is always hard, not that we don‚Äôt have ideas, but the problem sometimes is having notion on what you can do instead of what you what to do. I like a few genre of games, like RPG, FPS, platform etc. If I like to play them that‚Äôs the kind of games I would like to make but this doesn‚Äôt I should do it.\nVizati was a cautions step without getting too ambitious, we knew it wasn‚Äôt a game to get us ‚Äúrich and fame‚Äù but we wanted to prove ourselves that we could make a game from start to finish in a viable time.

Also it won‚Äôt slow down everything and if you think it does just check screen orientation at greater intervals.\nSome cool things you can do it when switching to iterate the rotation angle, that way you can simulate the screen rotation same way iOS does.

Every time a buffer is parsed I read another one and queue it.\nSolved the problem immediately. Yesterday while playing the game (after 10-20m) the sound started having hiccups again, although the game was fine, so I may still have some flaw in there, must research it more.\nHere‚Äôs a video where of me playing with some particles:\nPrimitives\nI can get much more particles on screen now because my first attempt to draw primitives in OpenGLES was drawing Quads with an mapped texture. When I got that working I would just send vertex points and texture coordinates and iterate all objects I wanted to draw.\nWROONGGGGGGG‚Ä¶..\nAlthough this works you should always batch as much geometry (within limits of course) as you can to make it on as fewer draw calls as you can. On both OpenGL and DirectX draw calls are the slowest part.\nIt‚Äôs faster to draw 1000 triangles in one call than on 1 triangle per call. You get the point.\nSo I started by making a PrimitiveBatch, sort of what XNA has, I just pass along vertex points, texture coordinates, color refs etc.\nSince it‚Äôs 2D I try to group by texture and by Z. All primitives with same texture on the same Z position can be drawn at once. You can‚Äôt draw all with same texture regardless of the Z some elements may be occluded when it was not intended, basically because it will keep drawing on top of what you have, at least for the current Buffer.\nAfter this I got enough drawing boost to have the same amount of particles that the PC version, which is cool.\nSome tips\nAlthough I‚Äôm still kind of new at this all iPhone things I can give you a few tips, they work for everything but are particular handy on devices with lower CPU power.\nAvoid using std::list:end(), on big lists it carries an extra burden. If you don‚Äôt intend to add/remove anything from the list during the cycle just save that at first\nstd::list::iterator b = _mylist.begin(); std::list::iterator e = _mylist.end(); while(b!=e) { /// Do stuff ++b; } Avoid deleting stuff on loops. One example, I have a list where I stack stuff to be drawn on my PrimitiveBatch, typically when you start drawing you add everything, the lists keeps growing, you draw and then delete, and you go back to ‚Äústart drawing‚Äù again. You can optimize this by never deleting and only creating on a need basis. Belize me it makes huge difference, and besides you will need to create that again so might as well not delete it and when starting over just update values. Small things like this may not be an issue on PC but on small devices every cycle counts. Most of this stuff you may already know but there are many who don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll try to update this more often.\nSo now I‚Äôll get back to my testing to see if we get to testing and later to the app store asap =)\nPS: I need iPhone/IPod Touch testers, drop me an email with your UDID if you are interested‚Ä¶\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/08/developers-log-stardate-26082010/","summary":"It‚Äôs been awhile since I last updated this, I‚Äôve have my hands full with Vizati iPhone.\nEver since I got an IPod Touch 2G it was easier for Rita to get a sense of the screen size (although we knew to be 320√ó480) it‚Äôs different when you are testing on the real thing, text looks smaller, other stuff looks way too big.\nHere‚Äôs a picture she took after a few adjustments.","title":"Developers log stardate 26082010"},{"content":"Just a quick post.\nGamersGate is having a Summer Special and Vizati is with a 50% discount, costing $4.47 / ‚Ç¨3.72 during this week only\nBuy your copy here and check out other awesome promotions here\nThis deal end up this August 15th\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/08/vizati-is-50-off-during-this-week/","summary":"Just a quick post.\nGamersGate is having a Summer Special and Vizati is with a 50% discount, costing $4.47 / ‚Ç¨3.72 during this week only\nBuy your copy here and check out other awesome promotions here\nThis deal end up this August 15th","title":"Vizati is 50% off during this week"},{"content":"I think the first game I ever played was Tetris on a 286 if my memory isn‚Äôt failing me.\nMy father worked at restaurant nearby a small apartment rental office, one of the dudes that worked there occasionally would let me play.

Basically because I‚Äôve been busy porting my engine Basalt to iPhone/iPad.\nIf you follow me on twitter you might have known this already since I ranted pretty much at start, moving platform and language is always painful if you are used to other conventions/shortcuts etc.\nSo it all started with my wish to port Vizati to the iPhone, since the game is already running on PC, Xbox360 and Windows Phone 7 one can only wish for an easy and quick port since pretty much all base code is done.\nAs you know for developing on the iPhone you require an actual Mac, I know there‚Äôs virtualization but my 5 year old PC can‚Äôt take it, believe me I tried. So I bought myself a mini mac which are much cheaper that IMac and macbooks, around $499 or so, and another extra $30 for a mini-Dvi to VGA adapter for my 1080p Samsung.\nLet me tell you, that bastard is silent, I mean I can‚Äôt listen to anything, powering off my desktop PC and I have this relaxing environment to work in, it‚Äôs great for coding during the night when everyone is asleep. I can only hear my keyboard strokes and my cat snoring.\nHere‚Äôs a picture of it near the keyboard, it‚Äôs really small.\nNow, moving on to the development part, on MacOS your IDE is XCode.\nIt‚Äôs no Visual Studio but it gets the job done. Has some strange shortcuts but I‚Äôve found a neat shortcut pdf.\nNext was my struggle for testing available engines and frameworks and learning how much of Objective-C do you have to know and can I run C++ on it?\nI tested some engines:\nCocos2D ‚Äì 2D engine, Purely Objective-C, very consistent API, it‚Äôs was very close to my way of making things on Basalt actually, with scenes and layers.\nSIO2 ‚Äì Mainly 3D stuff, might be a good starting point, it‚Äôs mainly coded in C++, has built in physics, Lua, lightning and shadow\nOolongEngine ‚Äì 3D engine, imports .3dsmax and .blend, bullet physics\nBork3D ‚Äì C++ engine based on Rude Engine. Seems good but I could only find one game made with it from the author itself, lacks documentation but at least it works. Had major performance issues on the iPad sample that comes with the SDK.\nI research a little on those well know tools such as Unity3D, ITorque, etc but those kind of editor aren‚Äôt really my thing.\nAt one point I convinced myself that the way to go would be learning Objective-C since most tutorials for iPhone are written using it, it‚Äôs Iphone OS native language and everyone recommends learning it, but after a few hours watching the amount of square brackets that things has on it I decided another way.\nI ported my C# engine Basalt to C++, literally making .h and .cpp files. I hooked up my main animation and draw pump to some Objective-C classes (don‚Äôt forget to use .mm if you are mixing Objective-C with C++) and everything started working.\nThe next bit was implementing the SpriteBatch class and make it draw in OpenGL, took me around two days to have the Matrices working, correct texture mapping to quads, Alpha Blend and Additive. The idea is that by the time I port an XNA game to C++ I can still use SpriteBatches, Texture2D etc.\nAfter these two weeks of development here‚Äôs what‚Äôs working:\nDraw Sprites ‚Äì SpriteBatch is working, texture regions, SpriteBlendModes, Matrices etc Sprite Animations Particle System 2D ‚Äì Although not a priority it allowed me to test Additive Independent Resolution Rendering ‚Äì Wasn‚Äôt much of deal actually, it‚Äôs basically a matrix JPG/PNG load ‚Äì I made this in Objective-C, 20 lines of code or so Here‚Äôs a video showing what I have so far:\nNext in my list is Input, Script, music and then porting the whole game to C++, which I think will work nicely once the whole engine base is done.\nOh, and probably try to get a real device for proper testing.\nPS: Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is awesome‚Ä¶.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/07/developing-on-mac-and-basalt-running-on-the-iphone/","summary":"It‚Äôs been around two weeks since my last post.

Visual Studio 2010 got available for both MSDN and DreamSpark subscribers.\nFirst time I installed VS2010 was in the RC form mainly because of WP7 Developer‚Äôs Tools and XNA4.0 but haven‚Äôt made many investment in searching for new features.\nBut being available at Dreamspark I downloaded the Professional version and decided to try it out a bit.","title":"Testing the new Visual Studio 2010 features"},{"content":" Note: 22/04/2013 ‚Äì Due to popular request I made an article about achieving this effect in OpenGL\nIndependent Resolution Rendering?? What‚Äôs this all about?\nBasically a way of not caring what you resolution is. Ever had Gui elements misplaced because you changed the resolution? Or getting out of the screen?\nIf you are doing a game on Xna just for Xbox360 you can basically use a 1280√ó720 base resolution and the Xbox will scale the game for you making the proper Letterbox.\nBut what about on Windows? Or if you use a different resolution on the Xbox? You have to manage that yourself.\nI‚Äôve made a small example on how to achieve this.\nBy the means of a class that I called Resolution ( just change it for whatever you feel it‚Äôs better) you can set both Virtual and Actual Resolution. Virtual or Base resolution is what I call the actual resolution in which I‚Äôll work everything, and you stick with it, for both moving sprites, calculations etc. It‚Äôs your working Resolution. The other one is the resolution at which the game is rendering, which we want to be independent of the game. So the class will scale your Virtual to the Actual, making a LetterBox or a PillarBox to match them.\nResolution.SetVirtualResolution(1280, 720); Resolution.SetResolution(800, 600, false); This is telling that you are working as if the game is on a 1280√ó720 but it is rendering on a window of 800√ó600.\nThe third flag is fullscreen or windowed.\nOn the main Draw Pump just add the following so that the class can make the appropriate viewport.\nResolution.BeginDraw(); Next whenever you make a SpriteBatch.Begin() you have to pass the Resolution Scale Matrix as the forth parameter:\nspriteBatch.Begin(SpriteBlendMode.AlphaBlend, SpriteSortMode.Immediate, SaveStateMode.SaveState, Resolution.getTransformationMatrix()); Now you can draw everything on the same way you would normally do\nspriteBatch.Draw(_texture, Vector2.Zero, Color.White); This said you can now change to different Resolutions keeping the same base and the same code and this will scale everything for you, neat right?\nHere are a few screenshots of an application (using Machinarium) with a Virtual resolution of 1024√ó768 on different real resolutions\nAn another example (using Braid) with a Virtual Resolution of 1280√ó720\nYou can download the project with the source here. Once again if you run into any mistakes (most probably üòõ ) let me know.\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/","summary":"Note: 22/04/2013 ‚Äì Due to popular request I made an article about achieving this effect in OpenGL\nIndependent Resolution Rendering??

What? But like now now?\nI went to http://developer.windowsphone.com/ and XNA Creator‚Äôs Club and there it was. The packages contains:\nA CTP of the new Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone Tools and framework to develop Windows Phone applications and games with Silverlight A CTP of XNA Game Studio 4.0 that allows you to develop Windows Phone games with the XNA Framework A Windows Phone 7 Series emulator that can be used to deploy and debug Windows Phone applications and games Add-on to allow you to use the Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate Release Candidate to develop Windows Phone applications and games if you have it installed Pretty good right? For those who have been living under a rock the XNA 4.0 brings another development platform, Windows Phone 7 series, which leaves us with XBOX360, PC and the new mobile.\nXNA 4.0 CTP requires Visual Studio 2010, download RC here, and for now it only allows debugging on PC and Windows Phone by means of an emulator. No Xbox360 deployment for now so don‚Äôt go converting your games and engines for now.\nStill this is a great way to test the new 4.0 features and Visual Studio which I honestly haven‚Äôt tried yet.\nI started a new Windows Phone 4.0 project and decided to test the emulator, on the above video you can see the touch feature working, took me 4minutes to get that working. Very easy, can‚Äôt wait for XNA final version.\nSome Images\nNotes for Game Studio developers (Shawn Hargreaves):\nAlthough this CTP includes Game Studio 4.0 assemblies for Windows as well as Windows Phone, it only supports the Reach profile. If you try to create a HiDef game, you will get an error saying your hardware does not support HiDef capabilities. Don‚Äôt worry, this doesn‚Äôt mean your GPU sucks, just that we don‚Äôt support HiDef in the CTP. The CTP does not support deployment to Xbox 360. The automatic scaling and rotation feature is not included in the CTP, so for now you must always choose 480√ó800 portrait resolution. If you want to make a landscape game, or render at some other resolution, the best way is to draw your scene into a rendertarget, then rotate or scale while copying it to the screen using SpriteBatch. This is not the best approach for performance or battery life on actual phone hardware, but don‚Äôt worry, you can take out the rendertarget code out once we release final bits that support the image scaler.

Although being a simple game somethings always turn out to be harder that we initial think. I‚Äôve been debating myself with some bugs on my engine, had to redo tons of code yesterday due to XBOX360 compatibilities (should have tested earlier :P). Two days ago Rita started doing the assets and it‚Äôs looking really good.\nBack to the development part yesterday I panicked when she asked me if it was possible to make some some small cutscenes on each level which could include moving images, changing an animation, trigger a sound, trigger another movement after another has finished etc.\nSome triggers and such would be suffice but since I like a good challenge and always loved Lua on C++ I decided to do a little research just to find that there isn‚Äôt many options for XNA, luainterface only works on Windows.\nI decided to write a little parser that finds functions from a file to C# delegates and vice versa.\nHere‚Äôs an example of what one of my scripts look like:\nfunction game_start\rset_background_image level2\rset_text name:level_indicator scene:main \u0026#34;Level 2\u0026#34;\tend function indicates the beginning of a function. I can call it by doing:\nScriptManager.Invoke(\u0026#34;game_start\u0026#34;); No binding of any kind are need till this point. Now if you read the first instruction on the script its set_background_image which is bind to a c# function, something like this:\nScriptManager.addBind(\u0026#34;set_background_image\u0026#34;, SB_set_background_image); Easy right? So now I can call my game_start function that can call other stuff on C#, I just have to hook it to a function. Any leading parameters after the instruction are passed send to it. In this case ‚Äúlevel2‚Äù which is the image name.\nAnother cool stuff I‚Äôve made and that you can see on the video below is a sleep.\nfunction game_start\rset_background_image level2\rsleep 2000\rset_text name:level_indicator scene:main \u0026#34;Level 2\u0026#34;\tend In this case the function will ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù for 2 seconds before resuming the next Line, and yes the rest of the game still carries on its normal way.\nThis may not seem much but after a few more tweaks I can make simple scripts pretty easy, not powerful as lua, not even close but it will work great for my Dream Build Play game.\nWatch the video below:\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2010/02/i-maed-a-custom-script-language-for-my-xna-engine/","summary":"Well the title is an Homage to James Silva‚Äòs I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES!!!1\nI‚Äôve been really busy with my Dream Build Play game lately.

Some are faster then others. Here are a few ways to improve your PHP code.\nLoop At some point your program will require a loop. And loop is considered as efficiency killer if you have many nested loop (means loop in a loop) as one loop will required to run ‚Äòn‚Äô times and if you have 1 nested loop, this means your program will have to run n2 times. There are many ways we can define a loop in PHP. But how do you know which one is the best way to loop your data? Apparently, using a for loop is better than foreach and while loop if the maximum loop is pre-calculated outside the for loop!\n// For each loop the count function is being called. for($i =0; $i \u0026lt; count($array);$i++){ echo \u0026#39;This is bad\u0026#39;; } #Better than foreach and while loop $total = (int)count($array); for($i =0; $i \u0026lt; $total;$i++){ echo \u0026#39;This better, max loop was pre-calculated\u0026#39;; } Single Vs Double Quotes single(‚Äô) quote is faster than double(‚Äù) quote. Why? Because PHP will scan through double quote strings for any PHP variables (additional operation). So unless you have a $var inside the string use single quotes.\n$var = \u0026#39;I have some text\u0026#39;; $var2 = \u0026#34;I have some text\u0026#34;; // We dont have vars so single would be good; $var3 = \u0026#34;I have some $var\u0026#34;; // In this case the double quotes is necessary Pre increment vs Post increment In PHP, it seems like pre increment is better than the other ways of performing an increment. Its around 10% better than post increment? The reason? Some said that post increment made certain copy unlike pre increment.\n$i++; $++i $i+=1; $i = $i + 1; Echo Vs Print echo is better. But how much better? Its around 12%-20% faster using echo compare to print when there is no $ symbol in the printing string. And around 40-80% faster if there is an $ symbol used in a printing string!\nDot Vs Commas Concatenation I use dot to concatenate my stuff. Such as the one shown below:\n$a = \u0026#39;PHP \u0026#39;; $b = \u0026#39;Tips\u0026#39;; echo $a.$b; The other way is:\n$a = \u0026#39;PHP \u0026#39;; $b = \u0026#39;Tips\u0026#39;; echo $a,$b; Tests show that dot is more preferable if there are no variables or $ symbol involved which is around 200% faster. On the other hand, commas will help to increase around 20%-35% efficiency when dealing with $ symbols.\nexplode Vs preg_split To split a string the usual way is to use explode because it support even on PHP4.0 and that‚Äôs also what i was taught on school. The answer in term of efficiency is explode. Split supports regular express and this makes it quite the same comparison between str_replace and preg_replace, anything that have regular expression support will usually be a bit more slower than those that doesn‚Äôt support it. It took around 20.563% faster using explode in PHP.\nThese benchmarks and others can be found here: http://net-beta.net/ubench/\n","permalink":"https://www.david-amador.com/2009/10/php-optimization-tips/","summary":"As most languages PHP allows many ways to solve a problem.

So for my tutorial I‚Äôll do all transformations using a Matrix.\nStart off by creating the basic class Camera2d\npublic class Camera2d { protected float _zoom; // Camera Zoom public Matrix _transform; // Matrix Transform public Vector2 _pos; // Camera Position protected float _rotation; // Camera Rotation public Camera2d() { _zoom = 1.0f; _rotation = 0.0f; _pos = Vector2.Zero; } } Now that we have the basic setup onto the variables it‚Äôs time to create a couple of functions to manipulate the variables\n// Sets and gets zoom public float Zoom { get { return _zoom; } set { _zoom = value; if (_zoom \u0026lt; 0.1f) _zoom = 0.1f; } // Negative zoom will flip image } public float Rotation { get {return _rotation; } set { _rotation = value; } } // Auxiliary function to move the camera public void Move(Vector2 amount) { _pos += amount; } // Get set position public Vector2 Pos { get{ return _pos; } set{ _pos = value; } } And now for the function that calculates all the transformations\npublic Matrix get_transformation(GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice) { _transform = // Thanks to o KB o for this solution Matrix.CreateTranslation(new Vector3(-_pos.X, -_pos.Y, 0)) * Matrix.CreateRotationZ(Rotation) * Matrix.CreateScale(new Vector3(Zoom, Zoom, 1)) * Matrix.CreateTranslation(new Vector3(ViewportWidth * 0.5f, ViewportHeight * 0.5f, 0)); return _transform; } So now how can we use it?\nSimple on your sprite batch begin you must add the camera transformation.\nCamera2d cam = new Camera2d(); cam.Pos = new Vector2(500.0f,200.0f); // cam.Zoom = 2.0f // Example of Zoom in // cam.Zoom = 0.5f // Example of Zoom out //// if using XNA 3.1 spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteBlendMode.AlphaBlend, SpriteSortMode.Immediate, SaveStateMode.SaveState, cam.get_transformation(device /*Send the variable that has your graphic device here*/)); //// if using XNA 4.0 spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.BackToFront, BlendState.AlphaBlend, null, null, null, null, cam.get_transformation(device /*Send the variable that has your graphic device here*/)); // Draw Everything // You can draw everything in their positions since the cam matrix has already done the maths for you spriteBatch.End(); // Call Sprite Batch End Found any errors?
