      <description>I think the first game I ever played was Tetris on a 286 if my memory isn’t failing me.
My father worked at restaurant nearby a small apartment rental office, one of the dudes that worked there occasionally would let me play. I remember one day he had this new game, Prince of Persia, my chin just fell, awesome,
I thought games couldn’t get any better. I remember always asking him to “type the code to play” as I called it, since it was DOS based.</description>
