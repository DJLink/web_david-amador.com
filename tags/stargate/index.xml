      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok so I got addicted to Stargate Atlantis as well. After watching all 10 seasons from SG-1 I decided to give it a try to Atlantis. I was not convinced that it would be a good show, but the it’s awesome. Atlantis starts around season 8 of SG-1 when Daniel Jackson figures the location of the lost city of Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlantis follows the adventures of a team that goes to Atlantis and being on another galaxy they only have power for one trip so it’s a one way trip only.&lt;br&gt;
The characters are great, and the show is very funny, mostly because of Rodney McKay. The new main enemy are the Wraith and the show is years ahead of SG-1 in special effects. I’m already on season 4 so I’m almost finishing.&lt;br&gt;
I recomend both show to everyone who gets a chance of viewing them. Since both have been canceled there’s a good chance your find packs containg the whole series. I found SG-1 complete on amazon last weekend.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369-300x200.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
