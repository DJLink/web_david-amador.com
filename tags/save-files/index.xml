      <description>Standards are a lovely thing, but hard to achieve, it depends on one thing, everyone actually using it, otherwise it’s just a rule no one cares about.
There is one thing that is very common to see in the “game sphere”:
Where are [X] save games located?
There are a couple of common directories used but I think as game developers we could do a bit better and using a common location.</description>

      <description>Quick question.
I’m trying to decide where my next game should store their save files so I decided to make a poll.
Personally I think that
C:/Users/$USER$/AppData/Local/ is a total idiotic thing.
Starting on Windows Vista there’s a pre-created “Saved Games” folder but most people seem to miss it since it’s not on the “My Documents” folder.
There’s also other possibilities which many games I own use like
My Documents\My Games\Game\ Others just create a folder directly on “My Documents” which some users find a bit obstructive.</description>
