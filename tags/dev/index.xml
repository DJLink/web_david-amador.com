      <description>Last time we talked I was porting the engine to run on the actual Xbox One hardware, since them I managed to port the whole engine, it’s now running (not 100% stable), sound, rending, and input, all working. Since that part is a bit better now I decided to focus some time on new content, such as localization, the new dungeons and stuff that still doesn’t properly work with a controller.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing a lot of menus and gamepad specifics related work lately.
My first step has been to make sure all menus are easy to use with a Xbox One controller, and while most of the menus in the main screen are usable, inside the game they are not.
Everything was made with mouse in mind at first so I decided to remake all of them again in a different way.</description>
