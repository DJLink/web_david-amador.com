      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to try Google Chrome today and was pleasantly surprised with it’s speed on loading pages. And I started seeing how slow my Firefox was. At first I thought that it might have something to do with the plugins I have, but then again they are very few, just Echofon, Firebug and Xmarks. So after a little digging I came up with a way to speed up Firefox 3, turn out it was all in the options =)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At first I thought that it might have something to do with the plugins I have, but then again they are very few, just Echofon, Firebug and Xmarks. So after a little digging I came up with a way to speed up Firefox 3, turn out it was all in the options =)</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Firefox, and type about:config in the address bar. Don’t worry about the warning that comes out.<img alt="about-config_warning" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/about-config_warning.gif" title="about-config_warning"></li>
<li><strong>Use the filter above</strong> to find <em>network.http.pipelining</em> and set it to True by double clicking on it.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new boolean value named</strong> <em>network.http.pipelining.firstrequest</em> and set that to True, as well.</li>
<li><strong>Find</strong> <em>network.http.pipelining.maxrequests</em>, double click on it, and change its value to 8.</li>
<li><strong>Now look for</strong> <em>network.http.proxy.pipelining</em> and again set it to True.</li>
<li><strong>Create two new integers named</strong> <em>nglayout.initialpaint.delay</em> and <em>content.notify.interval</em>, setting them to 0.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now restart your browser</strong> and see the results, mine is way faster loading stuff. Hope this helped.</p>
