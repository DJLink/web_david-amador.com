      <description>The day has finally arrived!!
Quest of Dungeons is now available in EU and US for your Wii U and/or Nintendo 3DS. If you search for the name on eShop in our device it should appear.
Game costs $8.99/€8.99 and allows for cross buy, so if you buy the game for Wii U you’ll get the Nintendo 3DS version for free (and vice-versa).

      <description>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?
It’s been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it’s time to talk about what’s been happening in the “backstage”.
I’m working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I’m juggling between two ports on my own.</description>

      <description>Nintendo fans rejoice!!!
It’s time to reveal what I’ve been up to lately, I’ve been very cryptic on Twitter about what I was actually doing but it was for a good cause, because Quest of Dungeons is making it’s way on to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
Development started a couple months ago, so I still don’t have an ETA, but from now on I can be less vague to what I’m really doing.</description>
