<p>I just got confirmation of the final release date for <strong>Quest of Dungeons</strong> on <strong>Wii U</strong>, it’s coming on <strong>September 29</strong>, both Europe and America. So we are nearly there, “hype.jpg”.</p>

<h2 id="faq"><strong>F.A.Q.</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>-Does it have off-TV support?</strong></em><br>
Yes, you can play with the GamePad only.</p>
<p><em><strong>-Does it support Wii U Pro Controller?</strong></em><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><em><strong>-What does the GamePad screen shows?</strong></em><br>
There are 3 different ways you can play the game</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-TV mode: You can play the game just on the GamePad.</li>
<li>TV-Only: In this mode everything is on the TV, just like the PC version, and you can play with either Wii U Pro Controller or GamePad</li>
<li>Mixed: GamePad shows a Minimap and touch Inventory (video below)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this covers most ways people enjoy using when playing on their Wii U.</p>
<p><em><strong>-How much?</strong></em><br>
Game will be sold at $8.99/€8.99/£7.99. I made the game cross-buy so you get the Nintendo 3DS version for free if you have the same NNID on both systems. See below for Nintendo 3DS version release.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-the-nintendo-3ds-version"><strong>So what about the Nintendo 3DS version?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="/2016/09/quest-of-dungeons-coming-to-nintendo-3ds-on-september-29/">Nintendo 3DS version will be released on September 29 as well.</a><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still don’t have a locked release date, next time I talk about it, it will be to announce when. Coordinating both versions of the game (on both regions) for a simultaneous release turned out to be a bit trickier than anticipated to the small team (1 person), I’m working on some last minute issues, and I’ll try to release it close as possible to the Wii U version. When I have the final release date I’ll let you know. It will be launched simultaneously on both regions as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="cross-buy"><strong>Cross-buy</strong></h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, the game will have cross-buy, so if you buy the Wii U version on September 29, when the Nintendo 3DS version gets released you will get it for free if you use the same NNID. So don’t feel shy to buy it, because you won’t have to choose one or another version.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions and spread the word.</p>

      <title>QoD 3DS/Wii U port devlog 1</title>

      <description>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?
It’s been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it’s time to talk about what’s been happening in the “backstage”.
I’m working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I’m juggling between two ports on my own.</description>

<p>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?</p>

<p>It’s been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons <a href="/2016/02/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u/"> for 3DS and Wii U</a>, so it’s time to talk about what’s been happening in the “backstage”.</p>
<p>I’m working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I’m juggling between two ports on my own.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, both are already up and running, graphics, sound, input, all of that is working (as far as I tested anyway. bugs yikes).</p>
<p>I had to greatly optimize some portions of the code for the 3DS version, because I want to try to target 60FPS, let’s see if I can accomplish that.</p>
<p>Wii U is obviously a more powerful machine so the pre-existing game code from the Xbox version, after I ported it to the Wii U, just ran.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if the game is running, what is left?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m doing specific features for both versions, and that takes time. Both consoles have a second touch screen for example, so I had to come up with a feasible way to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Wii U</strong></p>
<p>On Wii U you can play the traditional way, TV, but I also added off-tv support, so you can play just on the GamePad screen. I have Pro Controller support and another way you can play is a mix between TV and gamepad screen, where you can use a touch based inventory, map, etc to manage things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can even play with the Pro Controller, and watch the game on the gamepad screen, as a tiny TV. I spent the last few weeks adding these changes which I hope will prove useful for players.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line is:</strong> Yes, you can play only with buttons, like a “regular” game, but if you want, there is some gamepad use, but it’s optional.</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo 3DS</strong></p>
<p>The 3DS version is proving to be the most challenging one, first there were some technical issues I had to overcome, now is trying to fit all content in both those screens in a coherent way. If you played the other versions you know there is a fair amount of menus/UI at the user disposal, either to check inventory, character equipment, skills, buffs, quests, stats, etc.</p>
<p><em>UI/Dual Screen</em></p>
<p>I started by doing a 2 screen split-inventory, imagine the Xbox One but kind of split between 2 screens. So the list was on the top screen, and the item description on the bottom one. And that worked.</p>
<p><em>OLD</em></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_old_inventory.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_old_inventory.png" alt="qod_3ds_old_inventory"  />
</a></p>
<p>However I was never 100% happy with it, and I was barely using touch, which despite not being a personal favorite, I know I lot of people like, so I decided to throw all away and redo it differently. In a way that players could either touch items to open description (the second screen on the previous version) and then Eat/Equip/etc, but also that with a button press you can use it too, via dpad and a/b/x/y.</p>
<p>This is posing some challenges since I’m now trying to put everything that was on 2 screens into a single one, but I’ll get there.<br>
This is still WIP but I feel I’m getting near something a bit better.</p>
<p><em>NEW (WIP)</em></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_new_inventory.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_new_inventory.png" alt="qod_3ds_new_inventory"  />
</a></p>
<p><em>StreetPass</em></p>
<p>I never considered using StreetPass, but the other day I woke up with a cool idea. When you StreetPass someone you send and receive ghosts from previous runs to the other user. Here’s how it works, when you die, the game saves your character as it is, stats, equipment, etc. There is later a chance, that in a new game you might encounter yourself, but now you will also send those ghosts to the other players. So when you find ghosts from other users (they will have a icon in-game to make it different) if you defeat them, you’ll get all the loot. Cool right?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_qod_streetpass.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_qod_streetpass.png" alt="3ds_qod_streetpass"  />
</a></p>
<p>Final reminder, everything discussed here is WIP so it can change.<br>
So still no ETA, but I’m getting closer. And that is it for now. I’ll let you guys know when I have more news.</p>

      <description>Nintendo fans rejoice!!!
It’s time to reveal what I’ve been up to lately, I’ve been very cryptic on Twitter about what I was actually doing but it was for a good cause, because Quest of Dungeons is making it’s way on to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
Development started a couple months ago, so I still don’t have an ETA, but from now on I can be less vague to what I’m really doing.</description>
