      <description>If you use Tweetdeck you probably already know they screwed the new version (1.0) and you want to revert back.
Unfortunately since they are now part of Twitter I had a hard time finding the older build and decided to share it.

<p>If you are reaching this page in search for a way to revert to the non-paied version of Tweetdeck, becauseTwitter introduced all those crazy new rules, sorry, I have no solution.
