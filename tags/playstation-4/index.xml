      <description>EDIT: Release date will be January 17th 2017!
Exciting news, Quest of Dungeons is on itâ€™s way to PlayStation 4!!
Itâ€™s actually been in development for some time, and itâ€™s very near completion, so itâ€™s not going to be a huge wait until release hopefully.
The official QoD page on PlayStation went live just now so I decided it was a good time to let you know that this is happening, since Iâ€™ve been getting questions about a PS4 version for some time.</description>
