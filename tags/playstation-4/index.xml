      <description>Itâ€™s here, it finally happened! Quest of Dungeons is finally out for PlayStation 4 ðŸ˜€
PS4 dashboard showing Question of Dungeons
First of all, here are the links for the respective stores, you can also just search for the game and it should show on PSN Store.
US PSN Store: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/quest-of-dungeons/cid=UP1670-CUSA06182_00-QUESTDUNGEPS0001
EU PSN Store: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-gb/games/quest-of-dungeons/cid=EP1656-CUSA04830_00-QUESTDUNGEPS0001
Since I did this in the past, I decided to find a review video on Youtube that goes into detail about the game running on PS4, this should cover all things, so you can decide if this is a game that you might enjoy or not.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Release date will be January 17th 2017!
Exciting news, Quest of Dungeons is on itâ€™s way to PlayStation 4!!
Itâ€™s actually been in development for some time, and itâ€™s very near completion, so itâ€™s not going to be a huge wait until release hopefully.
The official QoD page on PlayStation went live just now so I decided it was a good time to let you know that this is happening, since Iâ€™ve been getting questions about a PS4 version for some time.</description>
