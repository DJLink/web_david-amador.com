      <description>Since Iâ€™m out of the countries where WP7 Marketplace is available itâ€™s been a real pain to check out new games and most of all if Vizati was already available.
Btw itâ€™s out there, go give it a try, thereâ€™s a trial mode. Itâ€™s great fun ðŸ™‚
So searching some forums I found a neat code to check this on the simulator.
Basically create a new WP7 Silverlight App and write this main page code</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m seeing a lot of forum threads with people asking how to save/load files on Windows Phone 7, well for XNA 4 in general.
You can use IsolatedStorage for that
&amp;lt;pre lang=&amp;#34;csharp&amp;#34;&amp;gt; using System.IO.IsolatedStorage; Both save and load can be done by creating a IsolatedStorageFile, I then use a Filestream and write with a binaryWriter
&amp;lt;pre lang=&amp;#34;csharp&amp;#34;&amp;gt; IsolatedStorageFile store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); // grab the storage FileStream stream = store.OpenFile(&amp;#34;test.txt&amp;#34;, FileMode.Create); // Open a file in Create mode BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(stream); float myvar = 5.</description>

      <title>Simulating tombstone (suspended state) on Windows Phone 7 emulator</title>

      <description>Since Windows Phone 7 doesnâ€™t have multitask, at least for now, Microsoft implemented a Tombstone notion in WP7 apps.
Itâ€™s basically a suspended state where you receive a notification that itâ€™s going to suspend but there is no guarantee that it will resume, it might be terminated so you must treat this as an exit and a might start again state.
So depending on you app you might want to save the current state just in case the app really closes.</description>

      <title>What are your target platforms for games?</title>

      <description>I decided to run a little poll to track what platforms do you target as a game developer. I think this should be interesting. Please share this post link or the direct link to the poll (http://twtpoll.com/dar51l) so that we can have more accurate results.
The poll closes in about 6 days and you can select various options of course.</description>

      <title>Developing on Mac and Basalt running on the iPhone</title>

      <description>Itâ€™s been around two weeks since my last post. Basically because Iâ€™ve been busy porting my engine Basalt to iPhone/iPad.
If you follow me on twitter you might have known this already since I ranted pretty much at start, moving platform and language is always painful if you are used to other conventions/shortcuts etc.
So it all started with my wish to port Vizati to the iPhone, since the game is already running on PC, Xbox360 and Windows Phone 7 one can only wish for an easy and quick port since pretty much all base code is done.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s been awhile since my last post. Iâ€™ve been utterly busy so I havenâ€™t had the time for any tutorials.
This week I got an invitation from JoÃ£o AntÃ£o to showcase Vizati as part of his XNA Framework presentation. This occurred during the Imagine Cup final on Portugal.
Iâ€™ve been playing with the WP7 tools and I decided to try and port Vizati to XNA 4.0 and give it a try on the emulator so I could show all 3 versions running simultaneous.</description>
