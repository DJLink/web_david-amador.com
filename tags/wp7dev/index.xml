      <description>Since I’m out of the countries where WP7 Marketplace is available it’s been a real pain to check out new games and most of all if Vizati was already available.
Btw it’s out there, go give it a try, there’s a trial mode. It’s great fun 🙂
So searching some forums I found a neat code to check this on the simulator.
Basically create a new WP7 Silverlight App and write this main page code</description>

      <description>I’m seeing a lot of forum threads with people asking how to save/load files on Windows Phone 7, well for XNA 4 in general.
You can use IsolatedStorage for that
using System.IO.IsolatedStorage; Both save and load can be done by creating a IsolatedStorageFile, I then use a Filestream and write with a binaryWriter
IsolatedStorageFile store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); // grab the storage FileStream stream = store.OpenFile(&amp;#34;test.txt&amp;#34;, FileMode.Create); // Open a file in Create mode BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(stream); float myvar = 5.</description>

      <title>Simulating tombstone (suspended state) on Windows Phone 7 emulator</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/09/simulating-tombstone-on-windows-phone-7-emulator/</link>

      <description>Since Windows Phone 7 doesn’t have multitask, at least for now, Microsoft implemented a Tombstone notion in WP7 apps.
It’s basically a suspended state where you receive a notification that it’s going to suspend but there is no guarantee that it will resume, it might be terminated so you must treat this as an exit and a might start again state.
So depending on you app you might want to save the current state just in case the app really closes.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since Windows Phone 7 doesn’t have multitask, at least for now, Microsoft implemented a Tombstone notion in WP7 apps.<br>
It’s basically a suspended state where you receive a notification that it’s going to suspend but there is no guarantee that it will resume, it might be terminated so you must treat this as an exit and a might start again state.</p>
<p>So depending on you app you might want to save the current state just in case the app really closes.</p>
<p>Simulating this on the emulator took me awhile to get it right.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wp7_start_button-300x206.jpg" alt=""  title="wp7_start_button"  />
</p>
<p>Press F5 on Visual Studio do start debugging your App.<br>
Press the Start button and your app received a Deactivated event. Save what you need. Now, and here is the tricky part, the debugger also exited.<br>
This took me awhile because pressing the back button wouldn’t do anything and pressing F5 again would just restart.</p>
<p>So you have to Press F5 and keep an eye on the compiler. When you receive a “Deploy Success” message</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/vs_deploy_success-300x88.jpg" alt=""  title="vs_deploy_success"  />
</p>
<p>quickly press the Back button on the simulator</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wp7_back_button-300x88.jpg" alt=""  title="wp7_back_button"  />
</p>
<p>You app should now start and receive the Activated event.<br>
Basically the debugger has to start between you pressing the Back button and before the black screen disappears otherwise the emulator while assume the app is closed and get back to home.</p>

      <description>I decided to run a little poll to track what platforms do you target as a game developer. I think this should be interesting. Please share this post link or the direct link to the poll (http://twtpoll.com/dar51l) so that we can have more accurate results.
The poll closes in about 6 days and you can select various options of course.</description>

      <title>Developing on Mac and Basalt running on the iPhone</title>

      <description>It’s been around two weeks since my last post. Basically because I’ve been busy porting my engine Basalt to iPhone/iPad.
If you follow me on twitter you might have known this already since I ranted pretty much at start, moving platform and language is always painful if you are used to other conventions/shortcuts etc.
So it all started with my wish to port Vizati to the iPhone, since the game is already running on PC, Xbox360 and Windows Phone 7 one can only wish for an easy and quick port since pretty much all base code is done.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been around two weeks since my last post. Basically because I’ve been busy porting my engine Basalt to iPhone/iPad.<br>
If you follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/DJ_Link">twitter</a> you might have known this already since I ranted pretty much at start, moving platform and language is always painful if you are used to other conventions/shortcuts etc.</p>
<p>So it all started with my wish to port Vizati to the iPhone, since the game is already running on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9vf17HSXcQ">PC</a>, Xbox360 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX18tuujAEY">Windows Phone 7</a> one can only wish for an easy and quick port since pretty much all base code is done.</p>
<p>As you know for developing on the iPhone you require an actual Mac, I know there’s virtualization but my 5 year old PC can’t take it, believe me I tried. So I bought myself a mini mac which are much cheaper that IMac and macbooks, around $499 or so, and another extra $30 for a mini-Dvi to VGA adapter for my 1080p Samsung.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, that bastard is silent, I mean I can’t listen to anything, powering off my desktop PC and I have this relaxing environment to work in, it’s great for coding during the night when everyone is asleep. I can only hear my keyboard strokes and my cat snoring.<br>
Here’s a picture of it near the keyboard, it’s really small.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSCF0003.jpg" alt=""  title="Mini Mac"  />
</p>
<p>Now, moving on to the development part, on MacOS your IDE is XCode.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/xcode.png" alt=""  title="xcode"  />
</p>
<p>It’s no Visual Studio but it gets the job done. Has some strange shortcuts but I’ve found a neat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413150630/http://www.1729.us/xcode/Xcode%20Shortcuts.pdf">shortcut pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Next was my struggle for testing available engines and frameworks and learning how much of Objective-C do you have to know and can I run C++ on it?</p>
<p>I tested some engines:<br>
<a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2D</a> – 2D engine, Purely Objective-C, very consistent API, it’s was very close to my way of making things on Basalt actually, with scenes and layers.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100726050150/http://sio2interactive.com/SIO2_Free_Open_Source_3D_Game_Engine_for_iPad,_iPhone_and_iPod_Touch/SIO2_Free_Open_Source_3D_Game_Engine_for_iPad,_iPhone_and_iPod_Touch.html">SIO2</a> – Mainly 3D stuff, might be a good starting point, it’s mainly coded in C++, has built in physics, Lua, lightning and shadow<br>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/oolongengine/">OolongEngine</a> – 3D engine, imports .3dsmax and .blend, bullet physics<br>
<a href="http://www.bork3d.com/">Bork3D</a> – C++ engine based on Rude Engine. Seems good but I could only find one game made with it from the author itself, lacks documentation but at least it works. Had major performance issues on the iPad sample that comes with the SDK.</p>
<p>I research a little on those well know tools such as Unity3D, ITorque, etc but those kind of editor aren’t really my thing.</p>
<p>At one point I convinced myself that the way to go would be learning Objective-C since most tutorials for iPhone are written using it, it’s Iphone OS native language and everyone recommends learning it, but after a few hours watching the amount of square brackets that things has on it I decided another way.</p>
<p>I ported my C# engine Basalt to C++, literally making .h and .cpp files. I hooked up my main animation and draw pump to some Objective-C classes (don’t forget to use .mm if you are mixing Objective-C with C++) and everything started working.</p>
<p>The next bit was implementing the SpriteBatch class and make it draw in OpenGL, took me around two days to have the Matrices working, correct texture mapping to quads, Alpha Blend and Additive. The idea is that by the time I port an XNA game to C++ I can still use SpriteBatches, Texture2D etc.</p>
<p>After these two weeks of development here’s what’s working:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IPhone-Basalt-Particle-System-2D.png" alt=""  title="iPhone Basalt Particle System 2D"  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw Sprites – SpriteBatch is working, texture regions, SpriteBlendModes, Matrices etc</li>
<li>Sprite Animations</li>
<li>Particle System 2D – Although not a priority it allowed me to test Additive</li>
<li>Independent Resolution Rendering – Wasn’t much of deal actually, it’s basically a matrix</li>
<li>JPG/PNG load – I made this in Objective-C, 20 lines of code or so</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a video showing what I have so far:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ALzSzhvp2ns" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Next in my list is Input, Script, music and then porting the whole game to C++, which I think will work nicely once the whole engine base is done.<br>
Oh, and probably try to get a real device for proper testing.</p>
<p>PS: Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is awesome….</p>

      <title>Vizati on Windows Phone 7</title>

      <description>It’s been awhile since my last post. I’ve been utterly busy so I haven’t had the time for any tutorials.
This week I got an invitation from João Antão to showcase Vizati as part of his XNA Framework presentation. This occurred during the Imagine Cup final on Portugal.
I’ve been playing with the WP7 tools and I decided to try and port Vizati to XNA 4.0 and give it a try on the emulator so I could show all 3 versions running simultaneous.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been awhile since my last post. I’ve been utterly busy so I haven’t had the time for any tutorials.<br>
This week I got an invitation from <a href="http://gozoomin.com/blogs/antao/">João Antão</a> to showcase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105005354/http://www.differentpixel.com/games/vizati/">Vizati</a> as part of his XNA Framework presentation. This occurred during the <a href="http://imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup final on Portugal</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing with the WP7 tools and I decided to try and port Vizati to XNA 4.0 and give it a try on the emulator so I could show all 3 versions running simultaneous.<br>
The result was pretty good i think. It’s virtually identical.</p>
<p>You can see it for yourself, the speed on the video is not very good due to the screen capture software.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hX18tuujAEY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Now for the tech part. Grabbing my 3.1 solution what have I made to have this running? What have I changed?</p>
<p>I had to create a XNA 4 empty project and add all code files and assets (no direct upgrade now)<br>
Had to change to TitleContainer for opening files, transparencies made with Color.A replaced to make use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100412140933/http://blogs.msdn.com:80/shawnhar/archive/2010/04/08/premultiplied-alpha-in-xna-game-studio-4-0.aspx">PreMultiplied Alpha</a>, basically using Color*Color.<br>
The assets are the same…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait …what? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this was a test I wanted to test how could the framework handle a simple platform change with minimal code changed, after all that’s the whole purpose of XNA. Of course on the final version proper assets will be placed but taking in account some 1024×1024 and higher images the results are pretty good.<br>
Notice the particle effects, there are around 2500 particles over there. And it’s on an emulator so I can’t wait to get my hands on the real deal.</p>
<p>Change the input to make use of the Touchscreen, and finally since I’m using my engine basalt I have <a href="/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/">independent resolution rendering</a> so I just told the system “run in 800×480 now” and the native resolution is still the PC/Xbox version one 1280×720.</p>
