      <description>So you have that Xbox360 controller laying around and want to connect it to your game?
On XNA this is an out of the box option but if you’re using C++ you have a bit more work to do first.
First of all, you will need the DirecX 9.0+ sdk.
The includes.
&amp;lt;pre lang=&amp;#34;cpp&amp;#34;&amp;gt; #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN // We don&amp;#39;t want the extra stuff like MFC and such #include &amp;lt;windows&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;xinput.</description>

      <description>I decided to run a little poll to track what platforms do you target as a game developer. I think this should be interesting. Please share this post link or the direct link to the poll (http://twtpoll.com/dar51l) so that we can have more accurate results.
The poll closes in about 6 days and you can select various options of course.</description>

      <description>See the little black country on the map? It’s Portugal. The green zone are countries around Portugal that have XBOX Live Indie Games. We are surrounded by countries that can place their games on Creator’s Club but we were left behind. I won’t say there aren’t many others but they can speak for themselves.
I’m tired of watching developers from other countries being able to place their games there and we have to sit and watch.</description>
