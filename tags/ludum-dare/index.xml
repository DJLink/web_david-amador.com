      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been ages since my last post, feel like things keep getting in the way, also not much exciting stuff lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But decided to take a break from my current project to participate in Ludum Dare 42, it’s been years since the last time, also I liked the theme “Running out of Space” so I decided to hack something. To try and get out of my comfort zone I made my first game in Unity, so that was a fun experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It’s been ages since my last post, feel like things keep getting in the way, also not much exciting stuff lately.</p>
<p>But decided to take a break from my current project to participate in Ludum Dare 42, it’s been years since the last time, also I liked the theme “Running out of Space” so I decided to hack something. To try and get out of my comfort zone I made my first game in Unity, so that was a fun experiment.</p>
<p>The game is a small top down shooting game, but when you miss an enemy you create a block instead, so the more you miss the less area to fly around. Here’s a gif illustrating.</p>

<p>Made code, art and sounds, cod is c# in Unity, art was made in photoshop, the sound effects I think you’ll notice right away how they were made, and finally used <a href="https://boscaceoil.net/">Bosca Ceoil</a> for music.</p>
<p>There’s a webGl version so you an try it directly in your browser.</p>
