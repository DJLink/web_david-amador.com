      <description>Can’t believe it’s almost new year again.
It became a habit of mine to to hit pause for a couple minutes, look back, write about it and think about what’s next, this helps me to sort things out.
Thank you
I have to start with something, a big Thank You for all the people who purchased QoD, everyone who helped spreading the word, the ones who wrote emails, tweeted and help my solo developer work became an even better thing to do.</description>

      <description>WOW, 2014 is already coming to an end. Can’t even believe the amount of things that happened to me this year, some bad, some good, I decided to make a wall of text.
This was been a great year for my game dev objectives. In January I got Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam in only 6 days, which was mind blowing, on March 25th I finally got it released, and during the rest of the year several other platforms got a port, like Linux and Android, both platforms that I never had worked before, so I learned a lot.</description>

      <description>Another year has gone by, not quite what I was expecting developing wise, like putting another game out there, but things never turned out as planned.
Still over the last year I’ve gradually saw out little Different Pixel brand reaching more and more places which can be very helpful in the future and sure hell is nice to see work recognized.
From the top of my head I recall Kotaku article on the Xbox360 release, we finally managed to release the Xbox360 version, which was the first one we made.</description>

      <title>Wrapping up year 2010</title>

      <description>So another year has come to an end, time to make plans for a new one and look back on what has been done.
This was one crazy year, where I embraced indie development as my free time “hobby”.
This picture illustrates my year very well, dark link is a bonus since my twitter handle is DJ_Link
I’m tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.</description>
