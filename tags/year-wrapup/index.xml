      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;-2024&#34;&gt;🕛 2024&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially intended to do a &amp;ldquo;end of year&amp;rdquo; post BEFORE the EOY talking about some stuff, but that never happened because work and other things kept getting in the way. 2024 was a weird year, from work, to personal, to world, to finances, to game dev, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to everything really&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just feel tired honestly, that&amp;rsquo;s the best way I can describe 2024!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok that started in a weird way, but allow me some latitude here&amp;hellip;
The world is in a weird state, economy, layoffs everywhere, the game dev industry in a very fragile state; and suddenly every company is betting all their chips on &amp;ldquo;AAAAeee IIIIII&amp;rdquo;, politics seem wacko, climate change, social networks going bananas, overall everyone trying to find their feet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I initially intended to do a &ldquo;end of year&rdquo; post BEFORE the EOY talking about some stuff, but that never happened because work and other things kept getting in the way. 2024 was a weird year, from work, to personal, to world, to finances, to game dev, <em><strong>to everything really</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I just feel tired honestly, that&rsquo;s the best way I can describe 2024!</p>

<p>Ok that started in a weird way, but allow me some latitude here&hellip;
The world is in a weird state, economy, layoffs everywhere, the game dev industry in a very fragile state; and suddenly every company is betting all their chips on &ldquo;AAAAeee IIIIII&rdquo;, politics seem wacko, climate change, social networks going bananas, overall everyone trying to find their feet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to take the opportunity of Twitter going bananas to spend less time on social networks, it&rsquo;s just doom scrolling these days, but it propagated to every other place.</p>
<h2 id="games-and-such">Games and such</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t played many video games this year, I&rsquo;m still trying to finish Metroid Prime Remaster, I&rsquo;m SOOO STUCK on Phazon mines, I really want to finish this one as I&rsquo;m enjoying the game a lot, and I understand why it was so highly rated back then.</p>
<p><img alt="Stuck on Phazon Mines" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/stuck_on_phazon_mines.png"></p>
<p>I got the new Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom, and actually completed it, almost couldn&rsquo;t put it down until I did, it&rsquo;s such a nice game with tons of great ideas and mechanics, a merge of Breath of the Wild and Tears of Kingdom with Link Between Worlds. I really think this brings top-down Zeldas to a whole new level, can&rsquo;t wait for a new one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also played a bit of board games. For some reason I always assumed most board games were multiplayer, which would be harder for me, but there&rsquo;s actually tons of neat solo ones now, a booming market it seems, so I started playing some Arkham Horror, which I can play solo, and it&rsquo;s cool, even if I lose a lot.</p>
<p><img alt="Arkham Horror Card Game" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/arkham_horror_card_game_box.jpeg"></p>
<p>And just a couple days ago I decided to grab Carcassonne from my desk (been there a while unboxed) and take to play during the Xmas days break, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun to play with other people.</p>
<p><img alt="Carcassonne" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/carcassonne.jpg"></p>
<h1 id="travel">travel</h1>
<p>Every year I keep saying I should travel/rest more, and I haven&rsquo;t been taking a lot of free time/vacations, but I did manage to take a 6 days-vacation and a flight to Cabo Verde (they have low cost routes now). I visited Maio and Santiago islands, gorgeous landscapes and ocean views. To sum it up, within 2 hours of landing I got a rusty nail rip through my shoes (so lucky I hadn&rsquo;t changed into beach sandals yet), I also saw a dude accidentally fishing a baby Hammerhead shark, did some snorkeling and had a local convince me to try fishing, which I haven&rsquo;t done since my dad took me once as a kid, learned how to play an old board game with some locals, it was fun.</p>

<p>Sorry for video quality, in an attempt of not having tons of MBs on this page, and I really don&rsquo;t want to embed this on YouTube, so let me know if you know a better alternative to have videos on a blog post that &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="age">age</h1>
<p>I turned 40 this past year, yeah that&rsquo;s right, time does fly. Now this is not something that I usually discuss but the turn of a new decade does make you pause for a second, life comes fast. What I notice so far is most of the same things at early 30&rsquo;s but more, your body gives you more signs that you really need to pay attention to your health, it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;power it through&rdquo; anymore, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;maintenance mode&rdquo; now, whatever bad decisions you made in the past might show up now, any good ones you&rsquo;ll start to appreciate. Honestly my major problem has always been overworking myself and maybe not that good eating habits, that&rsquo;s the bad. On the good side, ever since I got a health scare right before my 30th birthday, I&rsquo;ve tried to be a bit more active (thanks Fitbit!) so in the past 10 years I&rsquo;ve actually managed to get into better physical shape, I do feel I&rsquo;m probably more in shape now than in my 20s and 30s;  I just can&rsquo;t do as much as 10 years ago, there&rsquo;s limits, we just have to work with them and move forward.
<img alt="Indiana Jones It&rsquo;s not the Years, It&rsquo;s the Mileage" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/indiana_jones_its_not_the_years_its_the_mileage.jpg"></p>
<h1 id="gamedev">gamedev</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been forever since I launched a game of my own even if I&rsquo;ve helped with dozens of games (porting) in the last few years, but it is what it is. It&rsquo;s hard to mix all in, and I can&rsquo;t do the whole &ldquo;quitting a job, work on a game for a couple months, launch it and get a new job after&rdquo; anymore, so development just takes &raquo;forever&laquo;  It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I don&rsquo;t even talk about what I&rsquo;m attempting to work on, I have no idea of deadlines because I can&rsquo;t probably do both contract deadlines + my own, which is both a blessing and a curse. It&rsquo;s not bad, but I still have a few more dumb games I want to work on, and release, I just feel like a bit of a fraud I haven&rsquo;t been able to after wrapping up QoD development, but I think that project also left me some burnout, it was ~7years of dev, porting and updates after all.</p>
<p>But for things we can control  a bit better, and while I like to tinker with my own <a href="/tags/basalt/">game framework</a>, it would be a mistake not to look into what&rsquo;s available in terms of Game Engines. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of contract work in Unity and GameMaker 2, including some personal stuff, but after what <a href="/2023/09/unity-enshittification-round-2-moving-on-to-custom-tech/">Unity pulled</a> (over a year now), using Unity now leaves a sour taste, it&rsquo;s not the same anymore.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="godot">Godot</h1>
<p><a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> has been around since 2014, and gained popularity over the years, and like what happened with Mastodon when Twitter died (yes it&rsquo;s dead, old twitter is gone, X is crap), Godot exploded once Unity did what they did.
People became aware there was an open-source alternative, stable and ready to use, not controlled by maniac shareholders just trying to profit even if they had to fire everyone in the company.</p>
<p>Over the years I had read some stuff and devs talking about it, but never found the time, until a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>So I downloaded, unzip it, ran the executable, and &hellip; wait it booted the entire Editor within a couple seconds &hellip;</p>
<p><img alt="Godot Editor" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/godot_editor_new_scene.png"></p>
<p>My brain thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wtf there&rsquo;s no installer :O</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it just boots, a whole engine in a 250mb executable.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Language</strong></p>
<p>Godot allows a couple of languages, but there seems to be 2 main ones, and I was a bit on the fence if I should go with C# or GDScript, Godot&rsquo;s custom scripting language. So I decided to talk a bit with <a href="https://iohanna.itch.io/">Joana</a> about the pros and cons, she had also recently started using Godot herself. She went with C#, and seems like most of her Unity code worked fine, which is great.
But I decided to just dive into GDScript, a clean slate with &ldquo;no baggage&rdquo; is something that I enjoy from time to time, the idea of learning something new without trying to make existing things work sounded exciting; and I also remember the lessons from GameMaker 2 GML, at first there was friction, but there are some valid choices/ideals there that I sometimes think others could copy. Also if you want to use C#, for now, you need a dedicated Editor build and there&rsquo;s no support for Web Exports (this will change in the future).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html">GDScript</a> is at first glance very Python like, but it&rsquo;s mostly due to it&rsquo;s indentation-based syntax</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I use Python often for scripts so it was easy to get used to it. So far, from what I&rsquo;ve read, one of the downsides is if you need really intensive computation algorithms, in which maybe doing them directly in C++ or C# might be better, but that&rsquo;s probably edge cases, and you can mix in both languages, so not a decision that can ruin things later on.</p>
<p>In terms of language I do like it, it&rsquo;s clean, feels modern, and my only complaint so far is exactly the same as Python, I wish we had { } to wrap up scopes instead of tabs, but that&rsquo;s a personal preference. I&rsquo;m sure as months progress I&rsquo;ll bump into caveats, but that can be said of all languages.</p>
<h2 id="the-nodes-and-more">The Nodes and more</h2>
<p>Godot uses Nodes for everything, and at first I thought &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s like Unity GameObject&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not quite that, Nodes can only be used with 1 script, you can&rsquo;t just add a bunch of them to a node like Unity on a GameObject.</p>
<p><img alt="Godot Nodes" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nodes_and_scenes_nodes.jpg"></p>
<p>Here if you want a new behaviour, add a child node and add that script.
It seems odd at first but this comes with a very powerful &ldquo;side-effect&rdquo;, anything can be a scene, and you can add nodes in anything, it&rsquo;s quite fascinating and powerful, seems truly abstract.</p>
<p>The rest is the standard 2DSprites, Meshes, Sounds, position components, UI etc.
To learn this I decided to make a small prototype game and so far most stuff has been very easy to create, from UI to animations and game logic.</p>
<p>The part that is creating more friction for me right now, is the Editor UI/UX inconsistency, there are tons of small quirks (I&rsquo;ve been live posting some) that are not necessarily bugs but tweaking would go a long way in terms of User Experience and making it more intuitive.</p>
<p>Took me forever to notice that &ldquo;Animation&rdquo; was actually a button hiding a ton of options, it looked like a pressed &ldquo;Tab&rdquo;, it has the same design as the 0 on the left, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a button. I&rsquo;m nitpicking here, because it does work functionally, but I care about this engine now and I want it to be even better.</p>

<p>Godot is being made for free by the community, on their spare time, the fact that it works as it does right now is magic.</p>
<p><img alt="IT Crowd Have you tried turning it off and on again" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/have_you_tried_turning_it_off_and_on_again.jpg"></p>
<p>Sometimes I had to restart the editor to make some things work again (I read this on Reddit) and whenever some code isn&rsquo;t working but I can&rsquo;t quite understand why, I would just restart it. At least once a day this would happen, but it might also be due to my use of Visual Code as external code editor and it getting confused some times (I need to do more testing on this).</p>
<p>Right now the engine has tons of potential and I feel it&rsquo;s already quite robust for 2D games, I can&rsquo;t say for 3D because I haven&rsquo;t had the chance yet.</p>
<h1 id="plans-for-godot">Plans for Godot</h1>
<p>As the title suggests, for me this will be the year I plan to migrate to Godot whenever possible.</p>
<p>I do have a &ldquo;game&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m working on SLOOOWLY whenever I find some time, and getting it out of Unity would be a big plus for me. I initially started it as part of learning Unity for contact work purposes and I kept working on it, felt like a nightmare to move it to my custom framework due to amount of work (but doable), but moving to Godot actually sounds FUN! But it&rsquo;s not for now, I have to wrap up the gameplay at least so that migrating would be easier once I have it all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I wanted to say, Godot is a lot of fun to work with, you&rsquo;ll spot quirks very rapidly, but it&rsquo;s such a light and fast engine to work, perfect for prototyping.</p>
<p>Godot is in the same place as Blender a few year ago, with a promising future.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can’t believe it’s almost new year again.&lt;br&gt;
It became a habit of mine to to hit pause for a couple minutes, look back, write about it and think about what’s next, this helps me to sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have to start with something, a big Thank You for all the people who purchased QoD, everyone who helped spreading the word, the ones who wrote emails, tweeted and help my solo developer work became an even better thing to do. This wouldn’t be possible without everyone who supported me, in one way or another, so even if I do work a lot to make the best possible I can, if no one cared, it wouldn’t be possible, so thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Thank you</strong><br>

<p><strong>Indie life</strong><br>
I took the jump to full time indie developer this year again, back in March, it wasn’t something I was planning, but was semi forced to do because of some internal restructuring the company was having, so I left. With the <a href="/2014/12/im-a-xbox-one-developer-now-qod-getting-a-port/">Xbox One port of Quest of Dungeons</a> in hands, and falling behind on my personal deadlines, I decided to risk take a couple months and finish it. One one hand I have more freedom, and can work on games, on the other hand there’s the constant fear of “this is the last month” if everything fails and games stop selling. I also decided to start taking care of myself health-wise, by exercising more regularly, and for the most part of the year I did almost everyday a 6-8 KM fast-paced walk right after waking up, overall I fell much better, which helps with the mood and work altogether. The weird thing is that I had to get a gadget in order to feel more motivated, got a fitbit that tracks daily activity, been wearing it for 10 months now, so gamificating health ftw. Personal note, take some proper vacations next year, and by proper I mean, in any place, but disconnected from emails/work and whatever.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/944873_10156260342525364_3728126092064434364_n.jpg"><img alt="i find your lack of faith distrurbing" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/944873_10156260342525364_3728126092064434364_n-150x150.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>QoD on Xbox One</strong><br>
When I left in March, I was already way behind on my original launch plans, because developing for a console is a whole different thing and doing it during nights only was quickly draining my energies.<br>
The following months were mainly devoted to finishing the game, I had to redo a lot of the UI and gameplay to <a href="/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/">accommodate a game controller and other stuff</a>, but eventually on September 4 I <a href="/2015/09/quest-of-dungeons-is-now-available-on-xbox-one/">finally released it</a> and I was genuinely surprised by the overwhelming <a href="/2015/10/quest-of-dungeons-reviews-roundup/">positive feedback</a>, since, at that point the game was out for some time in its PC and Mobile form, but the new additions/changes and the fact that you could play it with a controller for the first time made it more appealing for many people.</p>
<p>Looking back, it took me a full year, from getting the game approved to the actual release. While it’s a lot of time, I also think it was worth it, a lot of the game was tweaked, also for some part I still had my day job, certifications take some time also. In fact the final build was finished around June, I just took those “extra” months to finding bugs/polishing and start to approach journalists/websites.</p>

<p><strong>GDC/Gamescom</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I’ve always wanted to attend, at least once, was GDC (Game Developers Conference), and this year I was finally able to, to the European one, which despite being expensive, is still less expensive then traveling to the US. And of course since it’s on the same week, I also went to Gamescom, and it was amazing, it’s much bigger then <a href="/2014/10/egx-2014/">EGX</a>, I had no idea. During GDC I was able to meet tons of cool developers, attend some parties (which is usually not my thing) and learn a lot overall.<br>
I was also able to watch a Video Games Live concert for the first time, and I loved it, even got a photo with Tommy Tallarico.</p>

<p><strong>Now &amp; Future(?)</strong></p>
<p>With the release of the XO version, a lot of people are asking what am I doing right now, “Are you on vacation?”, “New game?”. I can definitely say that I’m not on vacation mode right now, I’m already working on something for next year, which is kind of a semi-secret right now, mostly because I’m still unsure if I can pull it off. I started working on a concept for a new game, but something unexpected came up and it’s possible that Quest of Dungeons will get a new port, but now is not the time to talk about it, because at this point is not 100% sure it will, but that’s what I’m working on now.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Back_to_the_Future_time_travel_test_with_Michael_J._Fox_as_Marty_McFly.jpg"><img alt="Back to the Future (1985) Directed by Robert Zemeckis Shown from left: Christopher Lloyd (as Dr. Emmett Brown), Michael J.

<p>On a final note, another thing that comes to mind is that I’ve been blogging way less, I used to post a lot more stuff, especially tutorials of some kind, and I haven’t, so one of the things I wanna change is to write at least one post a month next year. It happened very little this year because I’ve been mostly working with NDA stuff and it’s hard to “Here’s how I fixed this”.</p>
<p>Happy New year!</p>

Can’t even believe the amount of things that happened to me this year, some bad, some good, I decided to make a wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was been a great year for my game dev objectives. In January I got &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/02/quest-of-dungeons-approved-on-steam/&#34; title=&#34;Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam&#34;&gt;Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam&lt;/a&gt; in only 6 days, which was mind blowing, on March 25th I finally got it released, and during the rest of the year several other platforms got a port, like Linux and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/&#34; title=&#34;Native game on Android – Porting Quest of Dungeons&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, both platforms that I never had worked before, so I learned a lot. Finally on October I got QoD &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2014/10/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-xbox-one/&#34;&gt;approved for Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Can’t even believe the amount of things that happened to me this year, some bad, some good, I decided to make a wall of text.</p>
<p>This was been a great year for my game dev objectives. In January I got <a href="/2014/02/quest-of-dungeons-approved-on-steam/" title="Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam">Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam</a> in only 6 days, which was mind blowing, on March 25th I finally got it released, and during the rest of the year several other platforms got a port, like Linux and <a href="/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/" title="Native game on Android – Porting Quest of Dungeons">Android</a>, both platforms that I never had worked before, so I learned a lot. Finally on October I got QoD <a href="/2014/10/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-xbox-one/">approved for Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be at <a href="/2014/10/egx-2014/" title="EGX 2014">EGX 2014 in London</a>, I loved it, this was my first time on such an event and I was amazed by everything, even more because I got to meet so many cool people, and other developers who I’ve been following their work for years.</p>
<p>Also I created a new brand for my indie games, called <a href="http://www.upfallstudios.com">Upfall Studios</a>, in order to give it a more professional look.</p>
<p>Not everything is good and this year I got a glimpse of what happens when you push yourself for years, I’ve been making games for quite some time now, switching between working on them full time or splitting with a day job (gotta pay rent), around February I collapsed, ended up in the hospital and had to take a 2 week sick leave, it was not pretty. So resolution for next year, taking care of myself better, work less but more efficiently.</p>
<p>It was kind of a weird year in gaming for me, I skipped the Wii completely (last generation was the Xbox 360) but for this generation I got the WiiU, which I love btw, and I started having that nostalgia feeling and playing older games, in fact I spent Christmas playing Super Mario World and Mario RPG on my SNES.</p>
<p><em>Some of the coolest games</em>:</p>
<p>Shovel Knight<br>
Crypt of the Necrodancer<br>
Nuclear Throne<br>
Mario Kart 8<br>
The Last of Us Remastered<br>
Bayonetta<br>
Super Mario 3D World<br>
Alien Isolation</p>
<p><em>Movies</em>:<br>
Guardians on the Galaxy<br>
OMG GO SEE INTERSTELLAR RIGHT NOW!!</p>
<p><em>TV Shows</em>:<br>
True Detective</p>
<p><em>(there are several other, this is just a very small curated list)</em></p>
<p>I have to idea what 2015 holds but I’m looking forward to it, the plans so far are to finish the Xbox One port and start working on the next project.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

      <title>post mortem of another year</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2012/01/post-mortem-of-another-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 21:43:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.david-amador.com/2012/01/post-mortem-of-another-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year has gone by, not quite what I was expecting developing wise, like putting another game out there, but things never turned out as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still over the last year I’ve gradually saw out little Different Pixel brand reaching more and more places which can be very helpful in the future and sure hell is nice to see work recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the top of my head I recall &lt;a href=&#34;http://kotaku.com/5820508/our-newest-xbox-live-indie-favorites-are-full-of-rainbows-and-death/gallery/5&#34;&gt;Kotaku article on the Xbox360 release&lt;/a&gt;, we finally managed to release the Xbox360 version, which was the first one we made. Being a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dreambuildplay.com/Main/SemiFinalists.aspx&#34;&gt;semi-finalist on Dream.Build.Play&lt;/a&gt; 2011 and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-show-mgs-menswear-gow-fitness-and-vizati-198288.phtml&#34;&gt;coverage on Destructoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another year has gone by, not quite what I was expecting developing wise, like putting another game out there, but things never turned out as planned.</p>
<p>Still over the last year I’ve gradually saw out little Different Pixel brand reaching more and more places which can be very helpful in the future and sure hell is nice to see work recognized.</p>
<p>From the top of my head I recall <a href="http://kotaku.com/5820508/our-newest-xbox-live-indie-favorites-are-full-of-rainbows-and-death/gallery/5">Kotaku article on the Xbox360 release</a>, we finally managed to release the Xbox360 version, which was the first one we made. Being a <a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com/Main/SemiFinalists.aspx">semi-finalist on Dream.Build.Play</a> 2011 and the <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-show-mgs-menswear-gow-fitness-and-vizati-198288.phtml">coverage on Destructoid</a>.</p>
<p>More and more I get to know developers from around the world and it’s been awesome, exchanging ideas, cultural stuff, helping solve trivial stuff that we sometimes miss, the indie dev community is really neat.</p>
<p>I worked most of this year on web development which is good and sucks at both time, on one hand it keeps me closer and updated on where technology/trend is headed and that’s always good, on the other hand I never really liked it that much and further more, all stuff now circles around Facebook, which I think is pathetic, get your own website, don’t host your company page on Facebook, it should be an alternative not the real thing.</p>
<p>I got accepted to the 2011 <a href="https://codebits.eu/">Codebits</a> which was a blast, seriously, I’m definitely trying to go this the 2012 edition as well.</p>
<p>Rant: One note to the people closer to me, asking me every now and then how many copies we sold it’s annoying, I don’t ask you how much you earn on your job do I?</p>
<p><strong>Favorite games:</strong><br>
Portal 2<br>
Rage<br>
Bastion<br>
Terraria<br>
Frozen Synapse<br>
(a couple more probably which I don’t recall)</p>
<p><strong>Favorite movies:</strong><br>
Real Steel<br>
Super 8<br>
Rise of the Planet of the Apes<br>
Source Code<br>
Mission Impossible 4<br>
Fast and Furious 5</p>
<p><strong>Favorite shows:</strong><br>
Breaking Bad<br>
Castle<br>
The Walking Dead<br>
Chuck</p>
<p>So my hopes for the next year are to be able to release the current game in the oven, I’m really glad Rita accepted once again to make another one. Not only because of her art but because the way she see games, bringing a new perspective to things, also because, most artists/coders I know just want to do 3D games which I personally think can ruin things sometimes just by adding a third dimension. Just watch what happened to Sonic once it went 3d.</p>
<p>Happy new Year!!</p>

      <title>Wrapping up year 2010</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/12/wrapping-up-year-2010/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So another year has come to an end, time to make plans for a new one and look back on what has been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one crazy year, where I embraced indie development as my free time “hobby”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/chibi_dark_link_icon_by_creamy423-d2xgzv9.png&#34; title=&#34;coding....&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture illustrates my year very well, dark link is a bonus since my twitter handle is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DJ_Link&#34;&gt;DJ_Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.&lt;br&gt;
Developing &lt;a href=&#34;https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati&#34;&gt;Vizati&lt;/a&gt; turned out a much more complex task that I imagined, making everything from the ground up, from engine to the actual game for 5 different platforms took me around 3x more time that I expected. Valuables lessons were learned so I’d be a fool to repeat those mistakes again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I don’t know what the future holds for me but I’m glad I took the chance to put something out there, gives me a sense of achievement and well, at least I tried, won’t carry this one to my grave 😛</p>
<p>For future plans well, I have stuff going on but can’t really go into details. We (<a href="http://www.differentpixel.com">Different Pixel</a>) will keep trying to bring cool games for all of you.<br>
Given the awful condition that Portugal is going though right now sometimes things seem hopeless, like rowing against the tide but I try to keep a general positive mind about it.</p>
<p>Oh, just realized, I’m writing this post from my new laptop, I was finally able to buy one, it’s not a high-end machine but it’s going to be handy for developing outside home 🙂</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DSCF0002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DSCF0002.jpg" title="DSCF0002"></a></p>
<p>I just want to say a big <strong>Thank You</strong> to everyone who bought Vizati, (btw, <a href="http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-VIZ/vizati">GamersGate is having a 65% off right now till Jan 2nd 2011, around €2.5</a>) everyone who sent us so many emails about it, feedback, comments, bugs etc.</p>
<p>On a personal side I want to thank <a href="http://www.rita-silva.com">Rita</a> for jumping the indie bandwagon with me thus making Different Pixel possible without my stick-man figures, her art is awesome. Vizati was highly praised on it’s artistic look and that’s all on her, so I can’t wait to show you guys more stuff. Also a big thank you for every of my twitter followers, you have helped me more that once and made me company during those long coding nights.</p>
