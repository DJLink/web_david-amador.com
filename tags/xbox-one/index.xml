      <description>A lot of you asked me how they could have their Xbox One controller to look like this
So today I‚Äôm sharing the template that you can use to print your own controller üòÄ
Start by downloading this image: (Right click, open in new tab, Hi-res download)
For my own controller I used a website called decalGirl, but use whatever similar service you prefer or a local store if you have it.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone!
You know that thing you‚Äôve been asking me these past few weeks? I finally have a release day.
I‚Äôm very pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Xbox One on September 4th via the ID@Xbox self-publishing program.
After months of development I‚Äôm very excited to finally be able say that it will be available on your console on that day.
Quest of Dungeons is a turn based roguelike game, featuring that good old 16-bit art style we grew up with.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been talking about some of the new stuff here and then, but it‚Äôs time to show the Xbox version in more detail. A lot of the UI was remade to allow proper gamepad support, several bugs and tweaks were made, and even new features. Lets take a closer look.
In game First of all, here‚Äôs how it looks in game, a very minimalist UI if I might say so.</description>

      <title>Necrodancer is joining</title>

      <description>Hi!
I‚Äôve been keeping this one a secret, but there‚Äôs going to a be a new class, a Necrodancer.
Yes you guessed it, it‚Äôs an homage to Cadence from the awesome game Crypt of the Necrodancer, you should buy it btw!
I‚Äôve been thinking about adding a new class for some time but never quite found anything interesting, each character, in my mind has it‚Äôs own personality and charisma and I was having a hard time finding any other interesting class.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone, just a small update. GDC 2015 is happening right now and last night a trailer was released for Quest of Dungeons running on the Xbox One.
I made all new footage, running at 1080p in 60FPS for this new trailer, but kept more or less the structure of the original one since I think it reflects well what the game is all about.</description>

      <description>Last time we talked I was porting the engine to run on the actual Xbox One hardware, since them I managed to port the whole engine, it‚Äôs now running (not 100% stable), sound, rending, and input, all working. Since that part is a bit better now I decided to focus some time on new content, such as localization, the new dungeons and stuff that still doesn‚Äôt properly work with a controller.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been tweaking a lot of the gameplay to be suitable to use with a game controller and I‚Äôm starting to like the way it‚Äôs headed, it‚Äôs much more streamlined, faster and easy to use than the first attempt I made, some beta testing with a group of people helped with that.
Last week I started porting the engine to DirectX, yeah it‚Äôs that fun moment where nothing works, crashes everywhere.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been doing a lot of menus and gamepad specifics related work lately.
My first step has been to make sure all menus are easy to use with a Xbox One controller, and while most of the menus in the main screen are usable, inside the game they are not.
Everything was made with mouse in mind at first so I decided to remake all of them again in a different way.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm very happy to announce that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Xbox One.
The game was released for the first time on Steam in March 25th and the response has been super positive so I‚Äôm excited to bring QoD to new players in a ‚Äúhome console‚Äù. I‚Äôll be handling the port myself, because that‚Äôs what a one man team means üôÇ I will keep you in the loop to what‚Äôs happening in the backstage so keep tuned‚Ä¶</description>
