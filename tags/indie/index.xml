      <description>1 – You either are, or you aren’t.
People can go and , “I’m an aspiring indie game developer”. You are either doing games or not, period. If you are starting in development with your own money then you are one. People tend to think they are indie developers when money starts rolling in, well think again, cause money may never come.
2 – It’s a jungle out there</description>

<p><strong>1 – You either are, or you aren’t.</strong><br>
People can go and , “I’m an aspiring indie game developer”. You are either doing games or not, period. If you are starting in development with your own money then you are one. People tend to think they are indie developers when money starts rolling in, well think again, cause money may never come.</p>
<p><strong>2 – It’s a jungle out there</strong><br>
There’s not a safe path on becoming a successful indie developer. It’s not like following another’s path will get you there. That’s why giving advices is just that, it might work or not.</p>
<p><strong>3 – There’s a minefield being left behind</strong><br>
We see it everywhere, indie bundles, pay what you want, fremium games, games at $1, the ones who made money with those models are leaving behind a bad legacy and an audience that doesn’t want to pay much.</p>
<p><strong>4 – Finish you stuff</strong><br>
You should actually be working instead of reading this.</p>
<p><strong>5 – You need to learn the rules</strong><br>
… to know when they must be broken</p>
<p><strong>6 – You need to break the rules</strong><br>
… to know why they matter.</p>
<p><strong>7 – Playing games does NOT make you a developer</strong><br>
Yet many think it’s all it takes, I’m good at playing thus I must be good at making them. You should however play critically, that is the key.</p>
<p><strong>8 – Working alone</strong><br>
..can be like rowing a boat with just one paddle.</p>
<p><strong>9 – Working with a team</strong><br>
…can be like two people on a bike, one steering and another one pedaling.</p>
<p><strong>10 – Overnight success</strong><br>
Out of nothing this indie developer! Overnight success! Million-dollar!<br>
And you think, “I can do that”. Yeah, except, those who are “overnight successes,” rarely appear out of nowhere. Minecraft? That dude’s been working in games for years. Super Meat Boy? I bet Edmund made over 30 games till now. They just stayed in obscurity for years. Work matters.</p>
<p><strong>11 – Learn to fall</strong><br>
This one’s hard especially if you think your game is great and the first comment is “This is sh**”. Learn from mistakes and do it again, but better.</p>
<p><strong>12 – Making games is hard work</strong><br>
…and you will shoot fire from your eyes to whoever says otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>13 – People who tell you to keep trying</strong><br>
…are mostly lying, they think you’re lazy and can’t get a real job.</p>
<p><strong>14 – Your parents will keep the hope</strong><br>
…that you get your act together and apply for IBM or Microsoft, cause that’s where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>15 – You will think twice</strong><br>
…when someone asks you what you do for a living. It would be the first thing said if you were a Doctor.</p>

      <title>Wrapping up year 2010</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/12/wrapping-up-year-2010/</link>

      <description>So another year has come to an end, time to make plans for a new one and look back on what has been done.
This was one crazy year, where I embraced indie development as my free time “hobby”.
This picture illustrates my year very well, dark link is a bonus since my twitter handle is DJ_Link
I’m tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.</description>

<p>This picture illustrates my year very well, dark link is a bonus since my twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/DJ_Link">DJ_Link</a></p>
<p>I’m tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.<br>
Developing <a href="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati">Vizati</a> turned out a much more complex task that I imagined, making everything from the ground up, from engine to the actual game for 5 different platforms took me around 3x more time that I expected. Valuables lessons were learned so I’d be a fool to repeat those mistakes again.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I don’t know what the future holds for me but I’m glad I took the chance to put something out there, gives me a sense of achievement and well, at least I tried, won’t carry this one to my grave 😛</p>
<p>For future plans well, I have stuff going on but can’t really go into details. We (<a href="http://www.differentpixel.com">Different Pixel</a>) will keep trying to bring cool games for all of you.<br>
Given the awful condition that Portugal is going though right now sometimes things seem hopeless, like rowing against the tide but I try to keep a general positive mind about it.</p>
<p>Oh, just realized, I’m writing this post from my new laptop, I was finally able to buy one, it’s not a high-end machine but it’s going to be handy for developing outside home 🙂</p>

</a></p>
<p>I just want to say a big <strong>Thank You</strong> to everyone who bought Vizati, (btw, <a href="http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-VIZ/vizati">GamersGate is having a 65% off right now till Jan 2nd 2011, around €2.5</a>) everyone who sent us so many emails about it, feedback, comments, bugs etc.</p>
<p>On a personal side I want to thank <a href="http://www.rita-silva.com">Rita</a> for jumping the indie bandwagon with me thus making Different Pixel possible without my stick-man figures, her art is awesome. Vizati was highly praised on it’s artistic look and that’s all on her, so I can’t wait to show you guys more stuff. Also a big thank you for every of my twitter followers, you have helped me more that once and made me company during those long coding nights.</p>

      <title>Make a Game Week</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2009/03/make-a-game-week/</link>

      <description>I work on a game creation company and this week the administration decided to give us a challenge, to make a game. Using whatever tools we want to whatever platform we like.
After we got divided between 4 teams the challenge was to make every minute count. My team got composed by me (programmer), a designer and a person from man resources. Of course I was going to handle every bit of code, the designer the art and the third person the level design and documentation.</description>

<p>We came up with a platform game called Cloud9 in which you have to return a star to the moon. The star has magical properties and can use the 4 basic elements.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/cloud9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/cloud9-300x222.jpg" alt="cloud9"  title="cloud9"  />
</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile the week went by and this is the last day. I spent most of the day building the level editor.</p>
