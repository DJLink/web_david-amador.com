      <title>Some thoughts about indie dev</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 – You either are, or you aren’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People often say, “I’m an aspiring indie game developer.” You are either making games or you’re not, period. If you are starting in development with your own money, then you are one. People tend to think they are indie developers only when the money starts rolling in. Think again, because the money may never come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 – It’s a jungle out there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There’s no safe path to becoming a successful indie developer. Following someone else’s path won’t necessarily get you there. That’s why giving advice is just that—it might work, or it might not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1 – You either are, or you aren’t.</strong><br>
People often say, “I’m an aspiring indie game developer.” You are either making games or you’re not, period. If you are starting in development with your own money, then you are one. People tend to think they are indie developers only when the money starts rolling in. Think again, because the money may never come.</p>
<p><strong>2 – It’s a jungle out there.</strong><br>
There’s no safe path to becoming a successful indie developer. Following someone else’s path won’t necessarily get you there. That’s why giving advice is just that—it might work, or it might not.</p>
<p><strong>3 – There’s a minefield being left behind.</strong><br>
We see it everywhere: indie bundles, pay-what-you-want models, freemium games, games priced at $1. Those who made money with these models are leaving behind a bad legacy and an audience that doesn’t want to pay much.</p>
<p><strong>4 – Finish your stuff.</strong><br>
You should actually be working instead of reading this.</p>
<p><strong>5 – You need to learn the rules&hellip;</strong><br>
…to know when they must be broken.</p>
<p><strong>6 – You need to break the rules&hellip;</strong><br>
…to know why they matter.</p>
<p><strong>7 – Playing games does NOT make you a developer.</strong><br>
Yet many think that’s all it takes: &ldquo;I’m good at playing, so I must be good at making them.&rdquo; You should, however, play critically—that is the key.</p>
<p><strong>8 – Working alone&hellip;</strong><br>
…can be like rowing a boat with just one paddle.</p>
<p><strong>9 – Working with a team&hellip;</strong><br>
…can be like two people on a bike: one steering and another pedaling.</p>
<p><strong>10 – Overnight success.</strong><br>
Out of nowhere, this indie developer becomes an &ldquo;overnight success!&rdquo; Million-dollar hits!<br>
And you think, “I can do that.”<br>
Yeah, except those who are “overnight successes” rarely appear out of nowhere. <em>Minecraft</em>? That guy had been working on games for years. <em>Super Meat Boy</em>? I bet Edmund had made over 30 games before that. They just stayed in obscurity for years. Work matters.</p>
<p><strong>11 – Learn to fall.</strong><br>
This one’s hard, especially if you think your game is great and the first comment is, “This is sh**.” Learn from mistakes and do it again, but better.</p>
<p><strong>12 – Making games is hard work&hellip;</strong><br>
…and you will shoot fire from your eyes at anyone who says otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>13 – People who tell you to keep trying&hellip;</strong><br>
…are mostly lying. They think you’re lazy and can’t get a real job.</p>
<p><strong>14 – Your parents will keep the hope&hellip;</strong><br>
…that you get your act together and apply to IBM or Microsoft, because that’s where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>15 – You will think twice&hellip;</strong><br>
…when someone asks you what you do for a living. If you were a doctor, it would be the first thing you’d say.</p>

      <title>Wrapping up year 2010</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/12/wrapping-up-year-2010/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2010 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/12/wrapping-up-year-2010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So another year has come to an end, time to make plans for a new one and look back on what has been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one crazy year, where I embraced indie development as my free time “hobby”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/chibi_dark_link_icon_by_creamy423-d2xgzv9.png&#34; title=&#34;coding....&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture illustrates my year very well, dark link is a bonus since my twitter handle is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DJ_Link&#34;&gt;DJ_Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.&lt;br&gt;
Developing &lt;a href=&#34;https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati&#34;&gt;Vizati&lt;/a&gt; turned out a much more complex task that I imagined, making everything from the ground up, from engine to the actual game for 5 different platforms took me around 3x more time that I expected. Valuables lessons were learned so I’d be a fool to repeat those mistakes again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I’m tired, but happy and hoping that these were the first steps on something greater and bigger.<br>
Developing <a href="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati">Vizati</a> turned out a much more complex task that I imagined, making everything from the ground up, from engine to the actual game for 5 different platforms took me around 3x more time that I expected.

<p>I don’t know what the future holds for me but I’m glad I took the chance to put something out there, gives me a sense of achievement and well, at least I tried, won’t carry this one to my grave 😛</p>
<p>For future plans well, I have stuff going on but can’t really go into details. We (<a href="http://www.differentpixel.com">Different Pixel</a>) will keep trying to bring cool games for all of you.<br>
Given the awful condition that Portugal is going though right now sometimes things seem hopeless, like rowing against the tide but I try to keep a general positive mind about it.</p>
<p>Oh, just realized, I’m writing this post from my new laptop, I was finally able to buy one, it’s not a high-end machine but it’s going to be handy for developing outside home 🙂</p>

<p>I just want to say a big <strong>Thank You</strong> to everyone who bought Vizati, (btw, <a href="http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-VIZ/vizati">GamersGate is having a 65% off right now till Jan 2nd 2011, around €2.5</a>) everyone who sent us so many emails about it, feedback, comments, bugs etc.</p>
<p>On a personal side I want to thank <a href="http://www.rita-silva.com">Rita</a> for jumping the indie bandwagon with me thus making Different Pixel possible without my stick-man figures, her art is awesome. Vizati was highly praised on it’s artistic look and that’s all on her, so I can’t wait to show you guys more stuff. Also a big thank you for every of my twitter followers, you have helped me more that once and made me company during those long coding nights.</p>

      <title>Make a Game Week</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2009/03/make-a-game-week/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work on a game creation company and this week the administration decided to give us a challenge, to make a game. Using whatever tools we want to whatever platform we like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got divided between 4 teams the challenge was to make every minute count. My team got composed by me (programmer), a designer and a person from man resources. Of course I was going to handle every bit of code, the designer the art and the third person the level design and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work on a game creation company and this week the administration decided to give us a challenge, to make a game. Using whatever tools we want to whatever platform we like.</p>
<p>After we got divided between 4 teams the challenge was to make every minute count. My team got composed by me (programmer), a designer and a person from man resources. Of course I was going to handle every bit of code, the designer the art and the third person the level design and documentation.</p>
<p>We came up with a platform game called Cloud9 in which you have to return a star to the moon. The star has magical properties and can use the 4 basic elements. <img alt="cloud9" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/cloud9.jpg" title="cloud9"></p>
<p>Meanwhile the week went by and this is the last day. I spent most of the day building the level editor.</p>
