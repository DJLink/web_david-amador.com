      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most painful tasks of a web developer/designer is to ensure that his website is compatible with the majority of the popular browsers. Nowadays this includes Firefox 2.0 and 3.0, Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8, Opera, and the newest Chrome. Well, you can have firefox, IE and Chrome all on the same system, but what about multiple versions? Most people still use IE6 (they should be shame by the way).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Adobe has launched a neat website for testing this, just go to <a href="https://browserlab.adobe.com/">https://browserlab.adobe.com/</a>, register an account and test it for yourself, it was a side by site view and even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning">Onion view</a></p>

      <title>How To Speed Up Firefox 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to try Google Chrome today and was pleasantly surprised with it’s speed on loading pages. And I started seeing how slow my Firefox was. At first I thought that it might have something to do with the plugins I have, but then again they are very few, just Echofon, Firebug and Xmarks. So after a little digging I came up with a way to speed up Firefox 3, turn out it was all in the options =)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So after a little digging I came up with a way to speed up Firefox 3, turn out it was all in the options =)</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Firefox, and type about:config in the address bar. Don’t worry about the warning that comes out.<img alt="about-config_warning" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/about-config_warning.gif" title="about-config_warning"></li>
<li><strong>Use the filter above</strong> to find <em>network.http.pipelining</em> and set it to True by double clicking on it.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new boolean value named</strong> <em>network.http.pipelining.firstrequest</em> and set that to True, as well.</li>
<li><strong>Find</strong> <em>network.http.pipelining.maxrequests</em>, double click on it, and change its value to 8.</li>
<li><strong>Now look for</strong> <em>network.http.proxy.pipelining</em> and again set it to True.</li>
<li><strong>Create two new integers named</strong> <em>nglayout.initialpaint.delay</em> and <em>content.notify.interval</em>, setting them to 0.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now restart your browser</strong> and see the results, mine is way faster loading stuff. Hope this helped.</p>
