      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dream Build Play submission deadline is over. Unfortunatly I didnâ€™t had the time to put my prototype working. Maybe next year. I always had the impression I would finish it on time cause the main goal was always IGF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Iâ€™ve been busy making the arrangements for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theindiebay.com&#34;&gt;The Indie Bay&lt;/a&gt; 48 hour &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theindiebay.com/competition&#34;&gt;game development competition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is for every entrant to make a game in 48 hours using a given theme or topic. Some cool prototypes may show up, games like Braid or World of Goo have been created in competitions like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Game Contests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally decided to compete on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.igf.com/&#34;&gt;IGF&lt;/a&gt;. Itâ€™s been for a long time I wanted to make a game but time is always short and Itâ€™s been postponed like forever, but this time Iâ€™m really going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I havenâ€™t started the development itself but the ideas and what we want to do as a game is decided. I wonâ€™t reveal anything by now, just that Iâ€™ll be working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rita-silva.com&#34;&gt;Rita,&lt;/a&gt; because the idea is to launch this as a&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.differentpixel.com&#34;&gt; Different Pixel&lt;/a&gt; game and that the target platform is PC/Xbox360. So if I have a playable demo by the time &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20161001023043/http://www.dreambuildplay.com/&#34;&gt;DreamBuildPlay&lt;/a&gt; deadline finishes itâ€™s a go to for that contest too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
