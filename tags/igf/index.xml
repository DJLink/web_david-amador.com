      <description>Dream Build Play submission deadline is over. Unfortunatly I didnâ€™t had the time to put my prototype working. Maybe next year. I always had the impression I would finish it on time cause the main goal was always IGF.
Meanwhile Iâ€™ve been busy making the arrangements for The Indie Bay 48 hour game development competition.
The idea is for every entrant to make a game in 48 hours using a given theme or topic.</description>

<p>Meanwhile Iâ€™ve been busy making the arrangements for <a href="http://www.theindiebay.com">The Indie Bay</a> 48 hour <a href="http://www.theindiebay.com/competition">game development competition</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is for every entrant to make a game in 48 hours using a given theme or topic. Some cool prototypes may show up, games like Braid or World of Goo have been created in competitions like this one.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m also writing a couple of tutorials for <a href="http://www.theindiebay.com/category/articles/xna/building-a-2d-game-engine-in-xna/">building a 2d Game Engine in XNA</a>.</p>

      <description>I finally decided to compete on IGF. Itâ€™s been for a long time I wanted to make a game but time is always short and Itâ€™s been postponed like forever, but this time Iâ€™m really going to do it.
I havenâ€™t started the development itself but the ideas and what we want to do as a game is decided. I wonâ€™t reveal anything by now, just that Iâ€™ll be working with Rita, because the idea is to launch this as a Different Pixel game and that the target platform is PC/Xbox360.</description>
