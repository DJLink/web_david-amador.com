      <description>&amp;gt; Hey everyone, wow ok so first of all it’s been a long time since my last post, I keep telling myself I need to return to do more regular posts, but twitter kinda replaced it in many ways for my daily-rambles. However I’ve been trying to work on something new and gotta get back to more regular blogging, but more on that later.
Second, but not least important, Vizati is turning 10 years old today (11 June 2010), feels only yesterday we (me coding and Rita with the art) were doing the first puzzles and trying to figure out the best way for making this a fun game.</description>

</a>&gt; Hey everyone, wow ok so first of all it’s been a long time since my last post, I keep telling myself I need to return to do more regular posts, but <a href="https://twitter.com/DJ_Link">twitter</a> kinda replaced it in many ways for my daily-rambles. However I’ve been trying to work on something new and gotta get back to more regular blogging, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Second, but not least important, Vizati is turning 10 years old today (11 June 2010), feels only yesterday we (me coding and <a href="http://rita-silva.com/" title="rita-silva.com/">Rita</a> with the art) were doing the first puzzles and trying to figure out the best way for making this a fun game. Things changed a lot over the years and the original team is no longer working together, also because of OS updates, like the iOS versions etc or hardware not being around anymore the game has mostly vanished from all stores. The other day I was thinking about game preservation and thought it would be a shame to leave this only in our computers, combined with the 10th anniversary we decided to make it free to everyone, the original game can now be downloaded and played even on the newest Windows versions (thank you XNA).</p>
<p>Here’s the official <a href="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati" title="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati">itch.io</a> page, there you’ll find not only the original XNA version that was being sold, but also an unfinished version using a custom engine that I build when porting it to iOS, this framework ended up powering <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com" title="https://www.questofdungeons.com">Quest of Dungeons</a>, a game I made a few years after. It’s not finished but should be mostly playable, although only works in window mode.</p>
<p>I also created a GitHub repo, which has a couple more things, like the original website code, some screenshots, the code using for creating the XNA installer, PDF manual and a couple more things. This way those things will never get lost in case my computer + backups ever go bad.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati">https://dj_link.itch.io/vizati</a><br>
GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/DJLink/Vizati">https://github.com/DJLink/Vizati</a></p>
<p>Hope you have fun, either you are rediscovering the game or playing it for the first time, it’s a product of it’s time, from an inexperienced team trying to make their first indie game, but I’m proud of how it turned out.</p>
<p>See you around!</p>

      <description>I decided to run a little poll to track what platforms do you target as a game developer. I think this should be interesting. Please share this post link or the direct link to the poll (http://twtpoll.com/dar51l) so that we can have more accurate results.
The poll closes in about 6 days and you can select various options of course.</description>

      <title>Making a XNA Game Installer</title>

      <description>I am going to start with a little rant about Visual Studio default Installer, you know, the one you can make for yout XNA games inside VS. Ugly and not very handy, sure it installs every dependency but doesn’t leave many options like….hum…I don’t know choosing the location where you want to install?
Moving along…I discovered this little cool installer called InnoSetup, and best of all it’s free.
InnoSetup has different ways of you building a proper installer but I am going to cover the script way, much more control.</description>

<p>Moving along…I discovered this little cool installer called <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</a>, and best of all it’s free.</p>
<p>InnoSetup has different ways of you building a proper installer but I am going to cover the script way, much more control.</p>
<p>I found a little startup script from Caliban Darlock for XNA 2 I think and I modified it for XNA 3.1</p>
<p>Start by downloading <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&amp;displaylang=en">vcredist_x86.exe</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&amp;displaylang=en">DotNetFX35Setup.exe</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=53867a2a-e249-4560-8011-98eb3e799ef2&amp;displaylang=en">xnafx31_redist.msi</a> and place them in a folder, I placed mine on D:\Game Development Tools\</p>
<p>Then onto the script</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>; Script generated by the Inno Setup Script Wizard.
; (Then extensively modified by Caliban Darklock.)

</code></pre><p>So you can basically copy paste this and save it as a .iss file. Should open on double click with Inno Setup Compiler once you install it.</p>
<p>It’s pretty straight forward and you can modify it with your paths and specific need.</p>
<p>Things to care about:<br>
<strong>#define MyAppLocation</strong> – This is where your Game Project is, typically one folder below the solution<br>
<strong>#define MyGameStudioLocation</strong> Folder to XNA Game Studio 3.1 Installation<br>
<strong>#define MyRedistLocation</strong> Folder where vcredist_x86.exe and xnafx31_redist.msi and DotNetFX35Setup.exe should be</p>
<p>The installer will also fetch every file inside you Release Folder. So you might wanna delete those .pdb files before doing it.</p>
<p>Hit Compile and there you go.</p>
<p>If everything goes alright the installer should test the registry for XNA and .NET 3.5 and install it if needed. I used Virtual PC with a clean Windows XP installation to test it and it worked. XNA got installed =)</p>

      <title>Vizati on Windows Phone 7</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/05/vizati-in-windows-phone-7/</link>

      <description>It’s been awhile since my last post. I’ve been utterly busy so I haven’t had the time for any tutorials.
This week I got an invitation from João Antão to showcase Vizati as part of his XNA Framework presentation. This occurred during the Imagine Cup final on Portugal.
I’ve been playing with the WP7 tools and I decided to try and port Vizati to XNA 4.0 and give it a try on the emulator so I could show all 3 versions running simultaneous.</description>

This week I got an invitation from <a href="http://gozoomin.com/blogs/antao/">João Antão</a> to showcase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105005354/http://www.differentpixel.com/games/vizati/">Vizati</a> as part of his XNA Framework presentation. This occurred during the <a href="http://imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup final on Portugal</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing with the WP7 tools and I decided to try and port Vizati to XNA 4.0 and give it a try on the emulator so I could show all 3 versions running simultaneous.<br>
The result was pretty good i think. It’s virtually identical.</p>
<p>You can see it for yourself, the speed on the video is not very good due to the screen capture software.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hX18tuujAEY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Now for the tech part. Grabbing my 3.1 solution what have I made to have this running? What have I changed?</p>
<p>I had to create a XNA 4 empty project and add all code files and assets (no direct upgrade now)<br>
Had to change to TitleContainer for opening files, transparencies made with Color.A replaced to make use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100412140933/http://blogs.msdn.com:80/shawnhar/archive/2010/04/08/premultiplied-alpha-in-xna-game-studio-4-0.aspx">PreMultiplied Alpha</a>, basically using Color*Color.<br>
The assets are the same…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait …what? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this was a test I wanted to test how could the framework handle a simple platform change with minimal code changed, after all that’s the whole purpose of XNA. Of course on the final version proper assets will be placed but taking in account some 1024×1024 and higher images the results are pretty good.<br>
Notice the particle effects, there are around 2500 particles over there. And it’s on an emulator so I can’t wait to get my hands on the real deal.</p>
<p>Change the input to make use of the Touchscreen, and finally since I’m using my engine basalt I have <a href="/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/">independent resolution rendering</a> so I just told the system “run in 800×480 now” and the native resolution is still the PC/Xbox version one 1280×720.</p>

      <title>Making Big Grass Tiled Backgrounds in XNA</title>

      <description>I’ve seen this quite a bit around on XNA forums and got 2 emails last week asking about this:
I want to make a 3000×3000 grass background by tiling this small grass image I have. Should I make one big image or should I make a for cycle drawing the image (3000/TileSize) times?
My answer is neither of them. The big image has a huge impact on every Draw and more, you are limiting your map to the max Texture Size the graphic card can handle.</description>

</blockquote>
<p>My answer is neither of them. The big image has a huge impact on every Draw and more, you are limiting your map to the max Texture Size the graphic card can handle.</p>
<p>The drawing lots of small images can actually work, if they are few. Let’s say your small texture size is 64×64. That means in order to fill up the 3000×3000 you have to draw it (3000/64) = 47 times. Since it’s a 3000×3000 that sums to (47×47) = 2209 Draws. Just for a background. Not to mention the rest of the actual game 😛</p>
<p>What if you could do this in just one Draw()?</p>
<p>It’s very very easy to achieve this effect by setting TextureAddressMode to Wrap. Basically giving it a bigger Rectangle but telling to wrap the texture so you are gonna get tiles =)</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tiling_01.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tiling_01-300x234.jpg" alt=""  title="tiling_01"  />
</a></p>
<p>You end up with this:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tiling_02.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tiling_02-300x234.jpg" alt=""  title="tiling_02"  />
</a></p>
<p>On a small test I made, using a 30000×30000 Rectangle I got a frame drop to 35 FPS by doing tons of regular Draws, when switching to Wrap mode a solid 60 FPS.</p>
<p>As I told you it’s very easy. I’ll write more advance tutorial one of this days on how to achieve cool effect like mixing two textures with a noise/normal map.</p>
<p>You can play with this sample by downloading it <a href="/xna_code/TilingSprites.zip">here</a>.</p>

      <description>Note: 22/04/2013 – Due to popular request I made an article about achieving this effect in OpenGL
Independent Resolution Rendering?? What’s this all about?
Basically a way of not caring what you resolution is. Ever had Gui elements misplaced because you changed the resolution? Or getting out of the screen?
If you are doing a game on Xna just for Xbox360 you can basically use a 1280×720 base resolution and the Xbox will scale the game for you making the proper Letterbox.</description>

<p>Independent Resolution Rendering?? What’s this all about?</p>
<p>Basically a way of not caring what you resolution is. Ever had Gui elements misplaced because you changed the resolution? Or getting out of the screen?</p>
<p>If you are doing a game on Xna just for Xbox360 you can basically use a 1280×720 base resolution and the Xbox will scale the game for you making the proper Letterbox.</p>
<p>But what about on Windows? Or if you use a different resolution on the Xbox? You have to manage that yourself.</p>
<p>I’ve made a small example on how to achieve this.</p>
<p>By the means of a class that I called Resolution ( just change it for whatever you feel it’s better) you can set both Virtual and Actual Resolution. Virtual or Base resolution is what I call the actual resolution in which I’ll work everything, and you stick with it, for both moving sprites, calculations etc. It’s your working Resolution. The other one is the resolution at which the game is rendering, which we want to be independent of the game. So the class will scale your Virtual to the Actual, making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterbox">LetterBox</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillarbox">PillarBox</a> to match them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">Resolution</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SetVirtualResolution</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1280</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">720</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">Resolution</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SetResolution</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">800</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">600</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is telling that you are working as if the game is on a 1280×720 but it is rendering on a window of 800×600.<br>
The third flag is fullscreen or windowed.</p>
<p>On the main Draw Pump just add the following so that the class can make the appropriate viewport.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">Resolution</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">BeginDraw</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next whenever you make a SpriteBatch.Begin() you have to pass the Resolution Scale Matrix as the forth parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">spriteBatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Begin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SpriteBlendMode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AlphaBlend</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                                   <span class="n">SpriteSortMode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Immediate</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                                   <span class="n">SaveStateMode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SaveState</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                                   <span class="n">Resolution</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getTransformationMatrix</span><span class="p">());</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now you can draw everything on the same way you would normally do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">spriteBatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_texture</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Vector2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Zero</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Color</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">White</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This said you can now change to different Resolutions keeping the same base and the same code and this will scale everything for you, neat right?</p>
<p>Here are a few screenshots of an application (using Machinarium) with a Virtual resolution of 1024×768 on different real resolutions</p>

      <description>So I was watching Microsoft Mix10 and while talking about the new Windows Phone 7 Series, Scott Guthrie announced the availability of the Windows Phone Developer Tools CTP. What? But like now now?
I went to http://developer.windowsphone.com/ and XNA Creator’s Club and there it was. The packages contains:
A CTP of the new Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone Tools and framework to develop Windows Phone applications and games with Silverlight A CTP of XNA Game Studio 4.</description>

<p>I went to <a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/">http://developer.windowsphone.com/</a> and XNA Creator’s Club and there it was. The packages contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CTP of the new Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone</li>
<li>Tools and framework to develop Windows Phone applications and games with Silverlight</li>
<li>A CTP of XNA Game Studio 4.0 that allows you to develop Windows Phone games with the XNA Framework</li>
<li>A Windows Phone 7 Series emulator that can be used to deploy and debug Windows Phone applications and games</li>
<li>Add-on to allow you to use the Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate Release Candidate to develop Windows Phone applications and games if you have it installed</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty good right? For those who have been living under a rock the XNA 4.0 brings another development platform, Windows Phone 7 series, which leaves us with XBOX360, PC and the new mobile.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/windows_phone_7.jpg" alt=""  title="windows_phone_7"  />
</p>
<p>XNA 4.0 CTP requires Visual Studio 2010, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx">download RC here</a>, and for now it only allows debugging on PC and Windows Phone by means of an emulator. No Xbox360 deployment for now so don’t go converting your games and engines for now.</p>
<p>Still this is a great way to test the new 4.0 features and Visual Studio which I honestly haven’t tried yet.</p>
<p>I started a new Windows Phone 4.0 project and decided to test the emulator, on the above video you can see the touch feature working, took me 4minutes to get that working. Very easy, can’t wait for XNA final version.</p>

<p>Notes for Game Studio developers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305042530/http://blogs.msdn.com:80/shawnhar/">Shawn Hargreaves</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Although this CTP includes Game Studio 4.0 assemblies for Windows as well as Windows Phone, it only supports the Reach profile. If you try to create a HiDef game, you will get an error saying your hardware does not support HiDef capabilities. Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean your GPU sucks, just that we don’t support HiDef in the CTP.</li>
<li>The CTP does not support deployment to Xbox 360.</li>
<li>The automatic scaling and rotation feature is not included in the CTP, so for now you must always choose 480×800 portrait resolution. If you want to make a landscape game, or render at some other resolution, the best way is to draw your scene into a rendertarget, then rotate or scale while copying it to the screen using SpriteBatch. This is not the best approach for performance or battery life on actual phone hardware, but don’t worry, you can take out the rendertarget code out once we release final bits that support the image scaler.</li>

      <description>Rita and I have been working on a demo for entering Dream Build Play competition and today she has finally finished the teaser for Vizati. It’s our game for entering the Dream Build Play 2010 competition and XNA Pizza Night. We started working on this around 3 weeks ago so it’s still an early draft from our vision of the game.
Vizati is a puzzle game made by Different Pixel for Dream Build Play 2010 in which you need to connect the little vizati stones by color.</description>

It’s our game for entering the Dream Build Play 2010 competition and XNA Pizza Night. We started working on this around 3 weeks ago so it’s still an early draft from our vision of the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vizati is a puzzle game made by Different Pixel for Dream Build Play 2010 in which you need to connect the little vizati stones by color. There’s 2 different modes of playing it. One of them is story mode where the stone Vizati is discovered by some people and they try to find out what it is and uncover it’s secrets. The other one, Arcade mode is a more traditional way to play it but with special vizati stones and power-ups</p>

<p>Also for anyone who has interest in these sort of things here’s my first successful test on the 360 of Vizati</p>

      <description>It’s been a long week.
Even though I’ve always pointed to a make a very simple game for Dream Build Play so that I may actually have the time to finish it I just lost almost two day doing something to show for about 3 or 4 seconds per level. Discussing how we should make our puzzle appear and disappear between each level we decided that a particle system or an effect of such nature would be nice to show apart from some fading or something on the puzzle itself.</description>

Even though I’ve always pointed to a make a very simple game for Dream Build Play so that I may actually have the time to finish it I just lost almost two day doing something to show for about 3 or 4 seconds per level. Discussing how we should make our puzzle appear and disappear between each level we decided that a particle system or an effect of such nature would be nice to show apart from some fading or something on the puzzle itself.<br>
Then it began, the one task that all programmers should ask someone else to do, because once you get the first one working you are gonna keep adding features because is so FUC**** pretty 😀</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ParticleSystem_Radial_Gravity.jpg" alt="ParticleSystem_Radial_Gravity.jpg"  />
</p>
<p>I decided the best way was to quick implement it on our editor Sapphire, it now features:<br>
– Color Interpolation<br>
– Alpha Interpolation<br>
– Scale Interpolation<br>
– Linear Gravity<br>
– Radial Gravity (This is more of a gravity Well, everything gets sucked in Geometry Wars style)</p>
<p>Here’s the video</p>

</div>

<p>Also I’ve found out that this March 5th near where I live Microsoft is doing a XNA Pizza Night, it’s a contest with prizes to the best games, and best of all, free Pizza and Drinks for everyone. I’m gonna enter with the same game of course so wish me luck.</p>

      <description>Well the title is an Homage to James Silva‘s I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES!!!1
I’ve been really busy with my Dream Build Play game lately. Although being a simple game somethings always turn out to be harder that we initial think. I’ve been debating myself with some bugs on my engine, had to redo tons of code yesterday due to XBOX360 compatibilities (should have tested earlier :P). Two days ago Rita started doing the assets and it’s looking really good.</description>

<p>I’ve been really busy with my Dream Build Play game lately. Although being a simple game somethings always turn out to be harder that we initial think. I’ve been debating myself with some bugs on my engine, had to redo tons of code yesterday due to XBOX360 compatibilities (should have tested earlier :P). Two days ago Rita started doing the assets and it’s looking really good.</p>
<p>Back to the development part yesterday I panicked when she asked me if it was possible to make some some small cutscenes on each level which could include moving images, changing an animation, trigger a sound, trigger another movement after another has finished etc.</p>
<p>Some triggers and such would be suffice but since I like a good challenge and always loved Lua on C++ I decided to do a little research just to find that there isn’t many options for XNA, luainterface only works on Windows.</p>
<p>I decided to write a little parser that finds functions from a file to C# delegates and vice versa.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what one of my scripts look like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
function game_start
	set_background_image  level2
	set_text name:level_indicator scene:main &#34;Level 2&#34;	
end
</code></pre><p>function indicates the beginning of a function. I can call it by doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">ScriptManager</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Invoke</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;game_start&#34;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>No binding of any kind are need till this point. Now if you read the first instruction on the script its set_background_image which is bind to a c# function, something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> <span class="n">ScriptManager</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">addBind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;set_background_image&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SB_set_background_image</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Easy right? So now I can call my game_start function that can call other stuff on C#, I just have to hook it to a function. Any leading parameters after the instruction are passed send to it. In this case “level2” which is the image name.</p>
<p>Another cool stuff I’ve made and that you can see on the video below is a sleep.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
function game_start
	set_background_image  level2
        sleep 2000
	set_text name:level_indicator scene:main &#34;Level 2&#34;	
end
</code></pre><p>In this case the function will “Sleep” for 2 seconds before resuming the next Line, and yes the rest of the game still carries on its normal way.<br>
This may not seem much but after a few more tweaks I can make simple scripts pretty easy, not powerful as lua, not even close but it will work great for my Dream Build Play game.<br>

      <title>Drawing Lines in XNA</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/01/drawing-lines-in-xna/</link>

      <description>One of the things I realized is very handy when prototyping or debugging is to draw a line on a specific location. Like drawing lines around collision boxes to see if your character is making a proper collision. For my games I’ve made a small LineBatch.
Basically LineBatch uses a SpriteBatch to draw the lines by stretching a 1×1 white Texture2D to your line size.
You can give it 2 points ( start and end point of course) and a color.</description>

      <description>I know there’s lot’s of this stuff over the internet but I keep bumping into people asking for this.
A way to easily switch from a Game Screen to a Menu or Options without having tons of flags and “if” clauses on the class Game.
I’ve made a small project with a Screen Manager. The ScreenManager is static and can contain Screens. Instead of having typical Draw Update functions drawing SpriteBatches on the Game class we should have something like this:</description>

<p>You’ll understand better by viewing the code itself. Use it in any way you want. I now this example may not be the best solution but it gives a good start to those wanting to implement their own.</p>

      <description>Lately all my free time has been spent adding new features to Basalt and developing Sapphire.
Some months ago, I started building Sapphire, a 2D editor for helping me creating to create my maps. Unfortunately I made a bad choice and decided to integrate XNA with Windows Forms, although I managed to do it it was a real pain to add something simple and eventually I dropped it.
Here’s a screenshot of the previous alpha version:</description>

<p>Some months ago, I started building Sapphire, a 2D editor for helping me creating to create my maps. Unfortunately I made a bad choice and decided to integrate XNA with Windows Forms, although I managed to do it it was a real pain to add something simple and eventually I dropped it.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of the previous alpha version:</p>

</a></p>
<p>I kept working on the engine itself and just making small prototypes for testing it. Finally 2 weeks ago I decided to start from scratch and just use xna to build it. Not much is done but I have little time after work to develop. Anyway I’m happy since I already have textures import, basic object positioning, scaling and a Layer System.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sapphire.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sapphire-150x150.jpg" alt="sapphire"  title="sapphire"  />
</a></p>
<p>This is an early stage of the new editor, it’s from last week.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>When I have some cool stuff I’ll update a new video.</p>
<p>On the engine side, today I decided to add a Console component to the engine, much like Source Engine and Quake consoles, to input commands, here’s the result:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Hopefully by the beginning of next year I’ll have a beta version that I can release to the public for testing. I intend to launch a free and a payed version of the engine+ editor. My only dout is if I trim down some functions or just release it as free for non-commercial usage only.</p>

      <description>Frame rate or FPS, how it is most commonly known is a way for you to know how many images per second is you game drawing. The more the better. Less then 30 and you start to see hiccups.
So how can you measure your frame rate in XNA?
Inside your game1 class declare these vars:

      <description>I am definitely a fan of ATI cards. Had a few Geforces but didn’t liked them very much. I actually noticed image quality decrease when switching from an old Radeon 9800 to a Geforce 8k something. I’m very happy with my Radeon 4890, now for the downside, PerfHUD, a very handy tool for Game Developers is only available for NVIDIA chipsets and although ATI has it’s own GPUPerfStudio it’s not the same thing.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am definitely a fan of ATI cards. Had a few Geforces but didn’t liked them very much. I actually noticed image quality decrease when switching from an old Radeon 9800 to a Geforce 8k something. I’m very happy with my Radeon 4890, now for the downside, PerfHUD, a very handy tool for Game Developers is only available for NVIDIA chipsets and although ATI has it’s own GPUPerfStudio it’s not the same thing.<br>
Anyway for those who have one and are developing for XNA you may have noticed that it doesn’t run PerfHUD out of the box.<br>
You will get an error, something like:<br>

<p>Luckily there’s a little trick we can use to fix this, first we create a new class:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This class basically searches for PerfHUD, so when you open it with it this class detects that the software exists and allows it’s usage. If not found, the regular GraphicDeviceManager is used. Now instead of creating a new GraphicsDeviceManager() on your Game class just do something like:</p>
