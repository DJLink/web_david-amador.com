      <description>Ok so I got addicted to Stargate Atlantis as well. After watching all 10 seasons from SG-1 I decided to give it a try to Atlantis. I was not convinced that it would be a good show, but the it’s awesome. Atlantis starts around season 8 of SG-1 when Daniel Jackson figures the location of the lost city of Atlantis.
Atlantis follows the adventures of a team that goes to Atlantis and being on another galaxy they only have power for one trip so it’s a one way trip only.</description>

The characters are great, and the show is very funny, mostly because of Rodney McKay. The new main enemy are the Wraith and the show is years ahead of SG-1 in special effects. I’m already on season 4 so I’m almost finishing.<br>
I recomend both show to everyone who gets a chance of viewing them. Since both have been canceled there’s a good chance your find packs containg the whole series. I found SG-1 complete on amazon last weekend.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369-300x200.jpg" alt="Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369"  title="Stargate_Atlantis_cast_100369"  />

      <description>I watched a really nice movie today, 28 Weeks Later.
I didn’t know anything about the movie so I got rather disappointed with the first 5-10 minutes. When the zombies showed up I thought to myself “not another zombie movie, are this guys out of ideas?” I sticked to see where it the plot was heading, and got a really nice surprise. After the initial outbreak in great Britain, the infected start to starve and they die eventually, so the movie starts 28 weeks later, when the general population starts returning to a safe zone called District One.</description>

I didn’t know anything about the movie so I got rather disappointed with the first 5-10 minutes. When the zombies showed up I thought to myself “not another zombie movie, are this guys out of ideas?” I sticked to see where it the plot was heading, and got a really nice surprise. After the initial outbreak in great Britain, the infected start to starve and they die eventually, so the movie starts 28 weeks later, when the general population starts returning to a safe zone called District One. The infection is still out there and the army is burning bodies around the safe zone. After a survivor is found, they discover that she is immune, however she can still contaminate others. The plot is simple but delivers, the acting is good and some familiar faces are there, such as Robert Carlyle, Harold Perrineau (Michael from Lost) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker).</p>

      <description>I started watching Stargate SG-1 on the beginning of this year, I’ve already had seen Season one, but it was almost 10 years ago so I decided to see from start.
I’m in the middle of season 4 and last weekend I saw what may well be the most funny episode of all, Window of Opportunity.
On this episode O’Neill and Teal’c get trapped on an endless loop, were events keep repeating themselves so, without any consequences to think on they decided to take the best of that time.</description>
