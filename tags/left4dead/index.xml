      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to buy another a new graphic card. I got tired of my old Geforce 8500 GT sloweness. It was slow on 3dsmax, it was slow on recent games and most of all I have this thing for Ati so this was never my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research I decided to get a XFX Ati Radeon 4890, most of the reviews were positive and its placed in a mid-range pricing. The first thing I was dissapointed was that my old Eurotech PSU would not be enough since my 12v rail had only 16A so I also bought a Corsair TX 650W.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>After some research I decided to get a XFX Ati Radeon 4890, most of the reviews were positive and its placed in a mid-range pricing. The first thing I was dissapointed was that my old Eurotech PSU would not be enough since my 12v rail had only 16A so I also bought a Corsair TX 650W.</p>
<p>After installing all I booted up the pc to find that the new psu was more silent that my old one but the xfx is louder, which is no surprise.</p>
<p>I was able to run Crysis at 1920Ã—1080 on very high with no antialiasing at a stable 30fps, so with a little tweaking i should be able to get a much higher framerate. Left 4 Dead at same resolution everything maxed up runs between 50-60 fps ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>Iâ€™m very happy with it. 3dsmax 2010 also runs faster and i notice the diference particularly on skining and mapping.</p>
