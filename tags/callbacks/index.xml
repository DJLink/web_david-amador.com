      <description>One of the things that was probably forgotten but the dudes who made C++ standard were callbacks, there’s no out of the box solution for Instance based Callbacks, just for functions.
When I moved to C# I was really happy with the way delegates work, it’s simple, easy and most of all, it works.
On game development one of the things callbacks are usually used is for Buttons, you have a menu and want to attribute a function to each button.</description>
