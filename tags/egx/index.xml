      <description>I had the chance of going to EGX in London this year with Quest of Dungeons.
The whole show lasted 4 days and it was AMAZING, met tons of players, and a lot of developers. Everyone was super friendly, so I had a lot of fun.
This was the first time I did something like this, so it was a very good way to get feedback and talk in person with players and even some fans of the game.</description>
