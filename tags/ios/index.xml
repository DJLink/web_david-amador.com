      <description>üìù It&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years It&amp;rsquo;s around 11 a.m. as start to type this. 10 years ago at this hour, I was at my day job, trying to focus and not be distracted by the fact that later that day, at around 18h, Quest of Dungeons was being released on Steam and iOS. For the first time, players around the world could try it. I was quite anxious about this; it had been a few years in the making, mostly nights and weekends.</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s around 11 a.m. as start to type this. 10 years ago at this hour, I was at my day job, trying to focus and not be distracted by the fact that later that day, at around 18h, <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com">Quest of Dungeons</a> was being released on Steam and iOS. For the first time, players around the world could try it. I was quite anxious about this; it had been a few years in the making, <a href="/2014/10/indie-dev-day-job-making-it-work-building-quest-of-dungeons/">mostly nights and weekends</a>. I had little idea of what to expect, but being on Steam was simultaneously exciting and terrifying. What if people hated it?</p>
<p>What follows for the rest of the post, is a brain dump of the timeline of some of the most crucial events of this silly little project for anyone who is curious.</p>

<p>‚úîÔ∏è Failing can help</p>
<p>Before the game launched, I had a few years of terrible prototypes, cancelled projects, and other unexpected life events. One day, though, all those mistakes fell into place, and QoD was born‚Äîa flow of ideas came to my mind, after seeing a bunch of stuff failed in front of me, but that maybe I could make them work. I knew what I wanted to avoid now and what I things I would like to experiment with. Within this time I also made a simple iOS game called <a href="/2012/09/puwang-a-5-day-work/">Puwang</a>, a gamejam compo, where most of the goal was to make a quick game and hopefully make $100 that year to cover the iOS developer account expenses. For QoD I wanted to make a small game that I could play on my phone during commute, and that&rsquo;s why it started as a mobile-only game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/qod_characters.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons characters"  />
</p>
<p>‚å®Ô∏è Expanding</p>
<p>During the time I was the only person to ever played it, I found myself enjoying it on a bigger screen/tablet, and after giving it a 2-3 friends to test and having confirmation, I thought it would be good to launch a desktop version along the iPhone/iPad versions, Windows and Mac.
This added some development time, but also allowed me to expand the game a bit more, the mobile version was virtually identical to desktop/tabled, but they shared a bigger UI, more suited for Mouse and the higher resolutions.
This turned out to be one of the best decisions, as the desktop version is foundation for everything after. At this point I was already <a href="/tags/basalt/">rolling my own engine</a> for prior games on mobile and desktop, so most of the development was indeed for game stuff, and not engine. While I&rsquo;ve made the mistake often of &ldquo;build the engine instead of game&rdquo;, here the engine was built around the game, that&rsquo;s how it should be.</p>
<h1 id="20140325---steam-and-ios-launch">2014/03/25 - Steam and iOS launch</h1>
<p>I had tried to bring games to Steam before but with no success. The focus was on Mobile, with Desktop in mind, but where to sell it? Before Steam I was able to get confirmation for the new Humble Store, but Steam was still on my mind. In the past I had higher hopes for my first game <a href="/tags/vizati/">Vizati</a>, looked more polished, so QoD didn&rsquo;t seemed to have a chance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screenshot-2022-11-01-at-19.38.50.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>But I decided to make a trailer and launch a GL page, and imagine my surprise when QoD was approved on Steam Greenlight within a week or so. Just look at my dumb face here that I just digged from some old Tweets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/david_amador_celebrating_qod_greenlight_2014-01-24_22.38.07.jpg" alt="David celebrating QoD approval on Steam Greenlight"  />
</p>
<p>With the trailer out, people seemed to enjoyed what they saw, I also thought I was near completing the game, there&rsquo;s always something right? So I pretty much crunched the entire rest of time between my day job and finishing the game.</p>
<p>Finally on March 25th it was out, everyone could play it. Since the game was only releasing around 18h on Steam, I went to my day job that day, and only took the next day off for checking &amp; fixing bugs etc.</p>
<p>Initially all I was getting was a flow of emails with some bugs and suggestions, but overall people seemed to like it, which was a relief. There was still tons of stuff to fix, but slowly, and for the next few weeks went through issues and suggestions. On the mobile side of things things were smoother, that version was the older one, had more testing, also less hardware configurations. I recall before launch, a conversation with some coworkers, that making it paid on mobile was probably a mistake, but I don&rsquo;t know how to design games around F2P/Ads, so I made it paid.  But, thankfully, even being a paid game, at $1.99, people were happy with what they were getting.</p>

</p>
<h1 id="20140530---linux">2014/05/30 - Linux</h1>
<p>This one was something that I had in the back on my mind for a while, theoretically my engine could be ported to Linux, but I was scared of having too many versions at launch, handing those 4 SKUs was already a handful, so this was left for later. This actually ended up being a factor in Humble Bundle contacting me to participate in one of their bundles, back then having a game on all 3 platforms was a must.
Technically speaking it wasn&rsquo;t extremely complicated, by this time the engine was already relatively split in ways that it was easy to integrate new OS, it was just a matter of implementation.
Also, now that Steam Deck is a thing, it just worked out of the box.</p>
<h1 id="20140826---android">2014/08/26 - Android</h1>
<p>With Desktops and iOS versions being well received I started getting requests for an Android version, I had never worked on this platform, but with most of the know bugs fixed, I bought a cheap Android phone and I moved into porting the game to this platform, you can read more about that <a href="/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/quest_of_dungeons_android_2014-05-29_00.05.50.jpg" alt="Quest of Dungeons Android"  />
</p>
<h1 id="2014---ouya-cancelled">2014 - OUYA (cancelled)</h1>
<p>The hot thing around the time was OUYA, games like TowerFall were born there, so since I had an Android version I started to work on that, because it would be the closest to a traditional console that I thought I could put this game on. I started working on it, but once Microsoft accepted my pitch for the Xbox One (see below), I placed this in low priority. Between the time it took me to develop the Xbox One version, OUYA had it downfall, and by that time I just cancelled it.</p>
<h1 id="201509---xbox-one">2015/09 - Xbox One</h1>
<p>In the summer of 2014, after the launch of all those versions, relatively successfully, I started talking with ID@Xbox with the possibility of bringing QoD to Xbox One. There were a couple months of paperwork and mostly the conversation about &ldquo;this is a mouse game, how will it work on consoles?&rdquo;, which was when I started seeing that all the UI needed to be remade, and even some gameplay.</p>
<p>There are several posts, <a href="/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/">here</a>, <a href="/2015/04/necrodancer-is-joining/">here</a>, <a href="/2014/11/qod-xo-devlog-1/">here</a>, <a href="/2015/01/qod-xo-devlog-2/">here</a> and <a href="/2015/02/qod-xo-devlog-3/">here</a>  detailing what went into to that process, but after around 1 year the game was finally released, and all the work put into reworking the game to controller friendly interface and gameplay paid off, it was <a href="/2015/10/quest-of-dungeons-reviews-roundup/">positively received</a>. I also took the opportunity to double the content available, and also add an <a href="/2015/04/necrodancer-is-joining/">extra character</a>. I&rsquo;m sure it was this combination of an almost remade version with increased content that led to it&rsquo;s positive feedback. I&rsquo;m really happy I decided to take all those months to remake it, it was daunting at first, I&rsquo;ll tell you that, but I&rsquo;m glad I did it.</p>

<h1 id="20160929---wii-u-and-nintendo-3ds">2016/09/29 - Wii U and Nintendo 3DS</h1>
<p>Around 2015 summer, before Xbox One release, and if I recall correctly, during Gamescom in Germany, I started talking with Nintendo about bringing the game to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.</p>
<p>This was when Nintendo was a bit more restrictive in terms of third party developers, and I was fully expecting, that me, a solo developer, would not make the cut, and it took a lot of months and patience to finally be able to show the game to someone and get accepted as an official Nintendo developer.</p>
<p>At first my goal was to make Wii U port first because it would be similar to Xbox One, with some additional features for the GamePad. Nintendo 3DS would come later, it would take more work due to it&rsquo;s specifics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending how you see it), I bricked my Wii U devKit after a couple months of work, when the game was in a good state already but before 100% finished. During the time I waited for repairs I started the Nintendo 3DS version.</p>
<p>I knew would take a LOT more work, from performance, to completely different UI for dual screen, hybrid of touch + buttons. But when the Wii U devKit arrived, I decided to launch them side-by-side, I talked with Nintendo about a cross-buy possibility, and once they gave the ok that was the goal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_new_inventory.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons StreetPass"  />
</p>
<p>The Nintendo 3DS version was one of the most complicated ones to pull off. This was also the first time that working on my own engine was the only thing making it possible. A lot of people were suggesting me to use Unity, and I had would have saved time in porting, which can be true, but Unity didn&rsquo;t supported 3DS, so it would never have happened if not for my custom framework.</p>
<p>This is hands down my favourite version, there is no other like it, mostly because of the nature of the device.</p>
<p>It was so fun to work with that I found myself <a href="/qod-3dswii-u-port-devlog-1/">adding features</a> just because I wanted to test them, like the StreetPass, where you can get ghosts from other players you pass on the street. Nintendo had a really neat device here.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3ds_qod_streetpass.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons StreetPass"  />
</p>
<p>There was some trouble having both versions on the same day, it&rsquo;s a lot of coordination required between me, Nintendo America and Europe teams, 4 different SKUs (3DS NA+EU, Wii U NA+EU), but in the end we made it.</p>
<p>Like I suspected during my own tests, on the 3DS it was the ideal portable version, it&rsquo;s a game that suits shorts sessions on the go.</p>
<p>This was also the first time I worked with a publisher for this game, for Japan, the game was published by Flyhigh Works, they took it to Tokyo Game Show, localized to JP, and were crucial in shaping up the 3DS version into what it is. I do recall many sessions where my stubbornness almost caused some bad decisions in the game, but they were really cool in guiding me to make the best of it.</p>

<h1 id="20170120---playstation-4-and-the-vita-version-that-never-was">2017/01/20 - PlayStation 4 and the Vita version that never was.</h1>
<p>I love my PlayStation 4, in fact it&rsquo;s the console I have more physical games for.</p>
<p>So it was with great excitement that after a Skype call with my PlayStation rep I had the greenlight to get the game there. This started around the time of Nintendo too, but sadly, and at first I wanted PS4 + Vita combo, like Wii U + 3DS, but for a variety of reasons the PlayStation Vita never happened.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons the PS4 versions was one of the latter ones, I kept hoping I could launch both simultaneously but never happened. Fun fact, this version almost had a physical edition that got cancelled by the publisher at last moment, eventually I even got someone, another publisher, to take care of the PS Vita version, but that also got cancelled later on. So a combination of things that happened that were no one&rsquo;s fault, but also made it a bit hard for me to explain why it wasn&rsquo;t happening. In certain moments it was almost, but it never did happened. It was a bit frustrating that I didn&rsquo;t had clear answers for the players regarding this, but I couldn&rsquo;t, and I tried but failed in the end. Well, that&rsquo;s game development.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/qod_ps4_no_name.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons on PlayStation 4"  />
</p>
<h1 id="20170810---nintendo-switch">2017/08/10 - Nintendo Switch</h1>
<p>Around 1 month after I released on Wii U and 3DS, Nintendo announced their new hybrid console, the Nintendo Switch. I immediately started getting questions from players about a port. This complicated promoting the new Nintendo versions while everyone was excited about the upcoming console, saving money for it and the games. By coincidence I had launched both versions right at the end.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall exactly when conversations started with Nintendo about this, since it was in hot demand, both for retail and developers, but eventually Nintendo shipped me a devKit and I started porting. It was released first in the Japanese regions, again by Flyhigh Works. But a few weeks later again by me in the rest of the world. This version had the portability of 3DS, and graphics/resolution and UI of the home consoles. This was also the first time I made a demo for the game, which still exists on the eShop.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/quest_of_dungeons_switch.jpg" alt="Quest of Dungeons on Nintendo Switch"  />
</p>
<h1 id="2019---dreamcast-just-having-fun">2019 - Dreamcast (just having fun)</h1>
<p>In 2019 I got my hands on a Dreamcast I decided to &ldquo;wonder if I can port it there?&rdquo;, it was never really meant for a full release, that would take months of time that I don&rsquo;t have at the moment,
I just posting it here for the record, this was under a week of work, it was fun. Maybe if I reach retirement I&rsquo;ll take some time to finish it. There&rsquo;s a lot of work left in there.</p>
<p>After a while booting the game on an emulator,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/qod_dreamcast_2.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons running on emulator 1"  />
</p>
<p>and then later when I got it booting on a real Dreamcast</p>

<h1 id="20210413---switch-physical-edition">2021/04/13 - Switch Physical Edition</h1>
<p>Like I mentioned before, I tried to get the game in physical format before, and I kept trying for years but it simply wasn&rsquo;t happening. Until 2021, when by random chance, someone recommended me Leoful, and they accepted right away, in fact, from initial contact to production, it was just a couple months, I&rsquo;m really happy I was able to finally get the game on an actual box, it hits differently, as I <a href="/2010/08/games-and-systems-from-childhood/">grew playing Nintendo games</a>,  and also feels like a closure to a project that started on a smaller device and made it&rsquo;s way to a real physical game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Quest-of-Dungeons-Nintendo-Switch-Physical-edition.png" alt="Quest of Dungeons Physical Edition for Nintendo Switch"  />
</p>
<h1 id="2022---">2022 - ??</h1>
<p>Right now the game still exists in several stores (R.I.P. Nintendo 3DS and Wii U), and it&rsquo;s in maintenance mode only. The platforms patched more regularly are the mobile ones, whenever Apple or Android come up with new rules or it breaks on new devices. Windows gives nearly no problems, MacOS breaks things more often, but overall it doesn&rsquo;t give a lot of work, the last time I had to mess with it, was the Linux version to patch stuff for Steam Deck, but it was relatively easy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/quest_of_dungeons_steam_deck.jpg" alt="Quest of Dungeons on Steam Deck"  />
</p>
<p>So in the end things worked out, and I want to say a big thank you to everyone who supported this project, I read all the emails, DMs, messages everyone sent over the years, even fanart, you rock.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gKx4R.gif" alt=""  />
</p>
<h1 id="some-trivia">Some trivia</h1>
<ul>
<li>The game has 79k of code (all platforms)</li>
<li>The game engine has 130k of code (all platforms)</li>
<li>Over 63800 years of total play time on Steam alone</li>
<li>The game allowing the player to drop items anywhere and being persistent was a side effect of saving the whole world to save instead of recreating it by seed. I just turned it into a feature.</li>
<li>I was only able to finish the game in Hell mode AFTER releasing it, the math seemed to check out, but I wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</li>
<li>The game was called Quest of Dungeons from day 1 of development, as a generic codename, I just grew too attached to it.</li>
<li>There was a pet system that got dropped, taming enemies, but it was dropped in favour of Shaman unique skill of summons.</li>
<li>There was a way for enemies to travel between floors, like Resident Evil added that later on, going between rooms, but it was too aggressive and made the game frustratingly hard.</li>
<li>All the level and combat damage math falls apart around character level 40 or above, but the game was designed below that.</li>
<li>The initial skull sign, which only exists at the very start, was a way to teach the player that death meant restarting, in 2013-14 roguelikes weren&rsquo;t as popular and it was seen as a shock for that to happen (play-testers would email me &ldquo;my save is lost&rdquo;). My goal was that by potentially learning that early on, the player would not get surprised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading all of this.</p>

      <description>I‚Äôm pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is finally out.
I didn‚Äôt get to make a post on day one, and it‚Äôs been nearly two weeks since launch but these past 2 weeks have been one crazy roller coaster.
It was released on March 25th, for PC, Mac and iOS. You can get it on Steam, iOS App Store or directly from the site via Humble Store.
I released all platforms on the same day, which was something I always wanted to try, and I have to say that it didn‚Äôt went as bad as I thought.</description>

<p>I‚Äôm pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is finally out.<br>
I didn‚Äôt get to make a post on day one, and it‚Äôs been nearly two weeks since launch but these past 2 weeks have been one crazy roller coaster.</p>
<p>It was released on March 25th, for PC, Mac and iOS. You can get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270050">Steam</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id698726956/">iOS App Store</a> or directly from the <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com/">site</a> via Humble Store.</p>
<p>I released all platforms on the same day, which was something I always wanted to try, and I have to say that it didn‚Äôt went as bad as I thought. As some of you know I have a day job so I had to take 2 vacation days to simple answer emails and do quick fixes, especially to the PC/Mac version. With each new software is natural to have problems at launch and Quest of Dungeons was no exception, and right now I‚Äôm still working on a daily basis in fixing some stuff and attending to some popular requests/changes from players to the game.</p>
<p>It was an extremely complicated task to do on my own, managing marketing, answering emails and tweets, scouting Steam forums to see if players are reporting problems, oh and do some actual coding, because you know, bugs don‚Äôt fix themselves. But overall I‚Äôm happy with the results so far.</p>
<p>The response to the game has been overall positive, and despite a few problems the game has gathered some good reviews.</p>

      <description>I‚Äôve been working on Quest of Dungeons and I‚Äôm nearing Gold. I‚Äôm attempting to release every version on the same day, which I never managed to do before but would like to do this time.
I have both the iOS, Mac and Windows version very stable, the Mac and iOS apps were already accepted by the App Store, for Windows I‚Äôm still trying to wrap up the process of getting it on a digital store too.</description>

I have both the iOS, Mac and Windows version very stable, the Mac and iOS apps were already accepted by the App Store, for Windows I‚Äôm still trying to wrap up the process of getting it on a digital store too. I‚Äôm just polishing the game and finishing some bugs, but I‚Äôm close, I can feel it =)<br>
Right now I‚Äôm targeting for a late January release, but I‚Äôll have a more precise date in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here are a couple of screenshots.</p>

      <title>Puwang - a 5 day work</title>

      <description>Hi, how‚Äôs everyone doing?
So this was a different week for me. It‚Äôs been a long time that I had the chance to work on a small prototype or a 48H competition because of my work on Dary‚Äôs Legend so I decided to stop for a couple of days and do something else.
Also my cat‚Äôs been quite sick, and between the Vet and taking care of him, working on a fun project gave me more time do everything.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, how‚Äôs everyone doing?</p>
<p>So this was a different week for me. It‚Äôs been a long time that I had the chance to work on a small prototype or a 48H competition because of my work on Dary‚Äôs Legend so I decided to stop for a couple of days and do something else.</p>
<p>Also my cat‚Äôs been quite sick, and between the Vet and taking care of him, working on a fun project gave me more time do everything.</p>
<p>Since I love shump games I decided to do one. The idea is simple, you are in a arena with your ship and you just blast enemies away.</p>
<p>Initially I worked around 6-8hours on this back in August but had to drop it because of some much other work I had, so it wasn‚Äôt until this monday I grabbed it again.</p>
<p>I decided to make the game for iOS because it‚Äôs easier to make prototypes there and I can carry them around everywhere, playing them, to see if they are any good.</p>
<p>Actually the first 8 hours where quite productive and this is what I had after that time:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sfxpNnfoZQI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>So during these past 5 days I polished it a little, grabbed myself a notepad and hand-drawn everything. It‚Äôs not much artistic, but I‚Äôm not a designer.<br>
Had a few problems with iOS 6 due to some deprecated stuff but in the end it all fall into place.<br>
Also some tweaks performance-wise on the Engine where made since with a lot of stuff on screen things can get out of control pretty easily specially on these portable devices.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 just came out and I even took the time to add support for those extra pixels, actually I just increased the viewport, no scaling.</p>
<p>I probably named it poorly but it‚Äôs <strong>Puwang</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puwang2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puwang2.png" alt=""  title="puwang2"  />
</a><br>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puwang.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puwang.png" alt=""  title="puwang"  />
</a><br>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puwang_icon_screen.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/puwang_icon_screen-200x300.png" alt=""  title="puwang_icon_screen"  />
</a></p>
<p>Also added some Leaderboards via Gamecenter and as I write this I‚Äôm starting to receive some feedback of the early beta builds I sent to a couple of testers. If people like it I might release it on the App Store.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

      <title>So what have I learned after eight months on the App Store</title>

      <description>First of all I think this is my last idevblogaday post for a while. I my math doesn‚Äôt fail me this is my 10th post and it‚Äôs time for someone to take turn. Actually it‚Äôs just the 9th.
I hope my words have somehow enriched your knowledge, in case you want to stick around just bookmark my feeds. I keep this fairly updated. Also since I‚Äôve been working on a new game</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First of all I think this is my last <a href="http://idevblogaday.com/">idevblogaday</a> post for a while. I my math doesn‚Äôt fail me this is my 10th post and it‚Äôs time for someone to take turn.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Actually it‚Äôs just the 9th.<br>
I hope my words have somehow enriched your knowledge, in case you want to stick around just bookmark my feeds. I keep this fairly updated. Also since I‚Äôve been working on a new game<br>
there‚Äôs probably news to share in the next 2-3 months.</p>
<p>Around 11 months ago I registered my App Store developer account. The idea‚Ä¶put Vizati on the iPhone.<br>
I‚Äôve never worked with Mac‚Äôs before, didn‚Äôt even have an iPhone/iPod or whatever. I just read that a bunch of people got rich and many more where making a living out of it.<br>
So here I go.</p>
<p><strong>Just placing an app there will sell</strong></p>
<p>My first BIG mistake was the general conception that ‚Äújust placing an app there will sell‚Äù. That‚Äôs probably true on the very first months the App Store opened. Not now, trust me. You release a new game, will probably have a few sales on the 1st day because it‚Äôs on the new released games and that‚Äôs it, only on very rare conditions will the game start selling very good with just that.<br>
So keep in mind advertisement on iOS is mandatory, forums, twitter, mailing list, whatever.<br>
The first month I was sending dozens of emails every single day to websites, journalists, magazines, some paid off, others didn‚Äôt.</p>
<p><strong>Release my app at a Thursday to be featured at that week‚Äôs App Featured Apps</strong></p>
<p>Although this might increase your odds, we released Vizati on a Friday, 2 weeks later it got a feature on the App Store, so it can still happen. Just create something cool and appealing.</p>
<p><strong>$0.99 is the way to go</strong></p>
<p>Wrong, don‚Äôt EVER place your app at $0.99 right from start. Evaluate it well, start higher. Having a higher price will help to distinguish it from others, will give you margin for promotions without making it free. Many costumers, tired of the enormous lists of game will only seek higher priced games because logic mandates that they are indeed better. If you think your app is not worth more that $0.99 go back to the drawing boards. There‚Äôs no sense in having crappy apps, 100 bad apps may not sell as much as 5 really good ones.<br>
Selling at a low price will also bring all kinds of customers, they will give you a 1 star just because you haven‚Äôt updated the app in 5 months or so. Customers that buy pricier app are more forgiving and respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Making a Free promotion will help boost sales afterwords</strong></p>
<p>True, for the first 2-3 days. Then you‚Äôll get back to whatever you where selling. Unless you have some in-game purchases it‚Äôs not worth it. Well only if you want to brag to your friends that your app got 100K downloads no matter the price. I‚Äôve tried this 3 times, each time I place it at a smarter occasion getting successfully more downloads, thing is that after 3 days of getting back to regular price things would slowly return to normal. Depending on promotion amount of days you may end up with the same money you would have not making the promotion. Also usually you will see your rating decreasing half or a full star, keep in mind, all kinds of people will download it.</p>
<p><strong>Answering to customers Feedback helps sales</strong></p>
<p>Obviously implementing a highly demanded features will make them happy thus recommending to friends. Just don‚Äôt go making all the changes they ask. Choose a position and defend it, show that things are the way they are because you choose so, not because of some mistake.</p>
<p><strong>People will buy all kinds of crap, just place one level.</strong></p>
<p>Also true, but just because they bought a ‚Äúfart app‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they wont‚Äô complain about your 15m duration game.</p>
<p>Well, time to go work on top secret project, see ya later</p>

      <description>Small side-note first, Vizati is now available for the Super Nintendo, more info.
For my third idevblogaday post I‚Äôm going to talk about Game Center.
Game Center was released only a couple months ago (September or so) but already tons of applications are using it and even more, players ask for it.
It‚Äôs a way to track achievements, leader boards etc. Unfortunately It‚Äôs only available from iOS 4.1+, so some compatibility check has to be done.</description>

      <description>When loading an application on an iPhone or iPad, a launch image can be shown to provide feedback to the user that the application is loading.
On the iPhone a Default.png was used, with the iPad we need to anticipate the device being started in any orientation.

      <title>Setting OpenGL view for iPhone 4 retina hi resolution</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/09/setting-opengl-view-for-iphone-4-retina-hi-resolution/</link>

      <description>This had me scratching my head for awhile.
At first I thought that glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES would properly detect Retina screen at 960√ó640 but it keeps returning 480√ó320.
A little explanation on Retina screen first. Older devices have 320√ó480 screen resolution. With new iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4G the screen has 640√ó960 but on the same physical area. This means that each pixel is 4 times as small.
To properly simulate older games resolutions iOS will replace each of your 320√ó480 game pixel by 4, this way your game will look identical.</description>

</p>
<p>So the API handles this differently. If you developed for iPad you notice that glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES return 1024√ó768 but not retina displays. Instead you have to check it yourself:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Easy right? Remember, you must do this before calling glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES.<br>
For touch positions just multiply each position by the scale factor.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve only tested this on the simulator since I don‚Äôt own an iPhone 4 but it should work and detect either you are on a regular or retina screen.</p>

      <title>Targetting iOS devices hardware</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/09/targetting-ios-devices-hardware/</link>

      <guid>https://www.david-amador.com/2010/09/targetting-ios-devices-hardware/</guid>
      <description>I decided to compile all iOS devices specs here so we can get a better glimpse on their hardware and what we can expect from them.
This covers iPhones, iPod Touches and iPad.
iPhone/iPhone 3G ‚Äì 412 MHz / 128MB / 320√ó480
iPhone 3GS ‚Äì 600 MHz / 256MB / 320√ó480
iPhone 4 -~800MHz / 512MB / 640√ó960
iPod Touch 1G ‚Äì 412 MHz / 128MB / 320√ó480
iPod Touch 2G ‚Äì 532 MHz / 128MB / 320√ó480</description>

<p>This covers iPhones, iPod Touches and iPad.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone/iPhone 3G</strong> ‚Äì 412 MHz / 128MB / 320√ó480<br>

<p><strong>iPad</strong> ‚Äì 1 GHz / 256MB /1024√ó768</p>
<p>I think this data is correct (Wikipedia) but let me know if some is wrong.</p>
<p>As you can see there‚Äôs some great deal of difference in CPU clocks on some models. So watch out if you want to target all generations since some games can be run slow on older devices.</p>
