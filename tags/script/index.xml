      <description>This week I’ve been working on replacing my current scripting system. It worked great for Vizati but I need something with a little more flexibility.
Instead of explaining what I’ve managed to get working I’ve made a screenshot with some notes.
I think I’m going to make this my #ScreenshotSaturday</description>

      <description>Well the title is an Homage to James Silva‘s I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES!!!1
I’ve been really busy with my Dream Build Play game lately. Although being a simple game somethings always turn out to be harder that we initial think. I’ve been debating myself with some bugs on my engine, had to redo tons of code yesterday due to XBOX360 compatibilities (should have tested earlier :P). Two days ago Rita started doing the assets and it’s looking really good.</description>
