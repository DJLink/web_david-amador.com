      <description>Spent a little time giving my blog a new look. It’s not that I didn’t like the old one but sometimes it was a bit of a mess, I’ve been getting many new readers so it was time for a cleaner look.
My main concern was getting all code posts to be readable but I think they are
class XPTO { public: XPTO(); }; Let me know if you find any errors, since I’m not going to dig up the whole blog finding errors =P</description>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">XPTO</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let me know if you find any errors, since I’m not going to dig up the whole blog finding errors =P<br>
Also feedback on the new layout is most appreciated.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looked before</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/david_amador_old_layout.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/david_amador_old_layout.jpg" alt=""  title="david_amador_old_layout"  />
</a></p>
<p>Another thing that’s been bothering me, which you may have noticed is that on the sidebar I have a small ad. It’s Google AdSense. I’ve been keeping it for almost 2 years now and I’m getting tired of it.<br>
Why don’t I remove it? Well because I managed to sum up $84 in these last 2 years. And google only pays when we reach $100. It’s a small amount but well it’s mine, so I can either forget it or keep with it.<br>
If I ever reach $100 and get paid I’m obviously removing it. I was hoping to use that money to pay for this blog hosting for another 1-2 years.</p>
<p>For those wondering those $84 where gathered from around 59k visitors. Some click it, others don’t and I get money each time someone clicks it. Simple as that.<br>
So until I reach those $100 I’m keeping it around.</p>
