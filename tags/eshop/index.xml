      <description>The day has finally arrived!!
Quest of Dungeons is now available in EU and US for your Wii U and/or Nintendo 3DS. If you search for the name on eShop in our device it should appear.
Game costs $8.99/€8.99 and allows for cross buy, so if you buy the game for Wii U you’ll get the Nintendo 3DS version for free (and vice-versa).

      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn’t had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I’ve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>
