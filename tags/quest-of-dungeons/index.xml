      <description>First of all, Happy Birthday to Quest of Dungeons 7th anniversary, initially released on March 25th 2014 for PC and iOS. QoD eventually got several other versions and big content updates over time, and that‚Äôs all thanks to the support of the fans, making it possible for me to continue working on it, so thank you.
One thing I got asked frequently was about a physical release, and it took a bit of time but I‚Äôm happy to announce that, in cooperation with Leoful, it‚Äôs finally happening, and soon too, release date is April 13 and pre-orders are live (begin tomorrow, March 26).</description>

      <description>EDIT (09/09/2017):
Europe and America are now scheduled for a September 14 release date.
Hey,
So this will be a quick post, as news started appearing on twitter a couple moments ago and I wanted to answer some questions.
Super happy to say that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo Switch. Every since Nintendo announced the console that I‚Äôve been getting questions so this will make a lot of people happy, and the best thing is that it‚Äôs not far away.</description>

      <description>Exactly 3 years ago today, March 25th, Quest of Dungeons was released on Steam and iOS.
Feels unreal thinking what happened in these past three years, for those who remember I wasn‚Äôt even sure the game could make it to Steam, let alone end up being accepted by PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for their consoles.
A couple of days ago I was thinking I should do something special for today, but instead of discounts or promotions I decided to write a couple of words to you, the community.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs here, it finally happened! Quest of Dungeons is finally out for PlayStation 4 üòÄ

First of all, here are the links for the respective stores, you can also just search for the game and it should show on PSN Store.
US PSN Store: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/quest-of-dungeons/cid=UP1670-CUSA06182_00-QUESTDUNGEPS0001
EU PSN Store: https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-gb/games/quest-of-dungeons/cid=EP1656-CUSA04830_00-QUESTDUNGEPS0001
Since I did this in the past, I decided to find a review video on Youtube that goes into detail about the game running on PS4, this should cover all things, so you can decide if this is a game that you might enjoy or not.</description>

      <description>As I‚Äôm starting to write this post I‚Äôm on my way to my home town for the holidays, so I may not post it in a couple days.
It‚Äôs been a crazy year(s)(?) and I‚Äôm taking these near 4h of travel to write down some things. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs incoherent, this is mostly a dump of thoughts.
For those who follow my work a bit more closely you probably know that for almost 4 years the project I dedicated more time was Quest of Dungeons, which started development in 2013.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Release date will be January 17th 2017!
Exciting news, Quest of Dungeons is on it‚Äôs way to PlayStation 4!!
It‚Äôs actually been in development for some time, and it‚Äôs very near completion, so it‚Äôs not going to be a huge wait until release hopefully.
The official QoD page on PlayStation went live just now so I decided it was a good time to let you know that this is happening, since I‚Äôve been getting questions about a PS4 version for some time.</description>

      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn‚Äôt had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I‚Äôve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>

      <description>So how are the Nintendo ports coming along?
It‚Äôs been sometime since I announced Quest of Dungeons for 3DS and Wii U, so it‚Äôs time to talk about what‚Äôs been happening in the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù.
I‚Äôm working on both versions at the same time, potentially for a simultaneous release. But this adds some extra challenges since both are very different and well, I‚Äôm juggling between two ports on my own.</description>

      <description>Nintendo fans rejoice!!!
It‚Äôs time to reveal what I‚Äôve been up to lately, I‚Äôve been very cryptic on Twitter about what I was actually doing but it was for a good cause, because Quest of Dungeons is making it‚Äôs way on to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
Development started a couple months ago, so I still don‚Äôt have an ETA, but from now on I can be less vague to what I‚Äôm really doing.</description>

      <description>Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost new year again.
It became a habit of mine to to hit pause for a couple minutes, look back, write about it and think about what‚Äôs next, this helps me to sort things out.
Thank you
I have to start with something, a big Thank You for all the people who purchased QoD, everyone who helped spreading the word, the ones who wrote emails, tweeted and help my solo developer work became an even better thing to do.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
Quest of Dungeons was released on Xbox One exactly a month ago, and the response has been very positive from both players and reviewers, so I decided to list a couple review links here. There are several more, and tons of Youtube videos, so thank you all for helping spreading the word.

      <description>Hey, it‚Äôs been a while.
For the past few months I‚Äôve been working on porting Quest of Dungeons to Xbox One, and I‚Äôm super happy that it‚Äôs finally out. It was released around a week ago, on September 4.
This took some time but I‚Äôm happy of the way the game is played with a gamepad, after a lot of changes to the UI I really feel like it was worth all the effort I put into it.</description>

      <description>A lot of you asked me how they could have their Xbox One controller to look like this
So today I‚Äôm sharing the template that you can use to print your own controller üòÄ
Start by downloading this image: (Right click, open in new tab, Hi-res download)
For my own controller I used a website called decalGirl, but use whatever similar service you prefer or a local store if you have it.</description>
