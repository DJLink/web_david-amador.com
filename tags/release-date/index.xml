      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn’t had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I’ve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>

<h2 id="faq">F.A.Q.</h2>
<p><em><strong>-Does it support the “older” Nintendo 3DS model?</strong></em><br>
Yes, game will run on all Nintendo 3DS models.</p>
<p><em><strong>-Does it support StreetPass?</strong></em><br>
Yes, see this <a href="/2016/05/qod-3dswii-u-port-devlog-1/">post (link)</a> for more information about how it works.</p>
<p><em><strong>-How much?</strong></em><br>
Game will be sold at $8.99/€8.99/£7.99. I made the game cross-buy so you get the Wii U version for free if you have the same NNID on both systems.</p>
<p><em><strong>-Does it have stereoscopic 3D?</strong></em><br>
No.</p>
<p><em><strong>-How many blocks does it require on SD Card?</strong></em><br>
Approximately 306 blocks (~39MB). <a href="https://twitter.com/UpfallStudios/status/780795144224305152">(link)</a></p>

<h2 id="faq"><strong>F.A.Q.</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>-Does it have off-TV support?</strong></em><br>
Yes, you can play with the GamePad only.</p>
<p><em><strong>-Does it support Wii U Pro Controller?</strong></em><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><em><strong>-What does the GamePad screen shows?</strong></em><br>
There are 3 different ways you can play the game</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-TV mode: You can play the game just on the GamePad.</li>
<li>TV-Only: In this mode everything is on the TV, just like the PC version, and you can play with either Wii U Pro Controller or GamePad</li>
<li>Mixed: GamePad shows a Minimap and touch Inventory (video below)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this covers most ways people enjoy using when playing on their Wii U.</p>
<p><em><strong>-How much?</strong></em><br>
Game will be sold at $8.99/€8.99/£7.99. I made the game cross-buy so you get the Nintendo 3DS version for free if you have the same NNID on both systems. See below for Nintendo 3DS version release.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-the-nintendo-3ds-version"><strong>So what about the Nintendo 3DS version?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="/2016/09/quest-of-dungeons-coming-to-nintendo-3ds-on-september-29/">Nintendo 3DS version will be released on September 29 as well.</a><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still don’t have a locked release date, next time I talk about it, it will be to announce when. Coordinating both versions of the game (on both regions) for a simultaneous release turned out to be a bit trickier than anticipated to the small team (1 person), I’m working on some last minute issues, and I’ll try to release it close as possible to the Wii U version. When I have the final release date I’ll let you know. It will be launched simultaneously on both regions as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="cross-buy"><strong>Cross-buy</strong></h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, the game will have cross-buy, so if you buy the Wii U version on September 29, when the Nintendo 3DS version gets released you will get it for free if you use the same NNID. So don’t feel shy to buy it, because you won’t have to choose one or another version.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions and spread the word.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>You know that thing you’ve been asking me these past few weeks? I finally have a release day.</p>
<p>I’m very pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is <strong>coming to Xbox One on</strong> <strong>September 4th</strong> via the ID@Xbox self-publishing program.</p>
<p>After months of development I’m very excited to finally be able say that it will be available on your console on that day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quest of Dungeons is a turn based roguelike game, featuring that good old 16-bit art style we grew up with.<br>
An evil Dark Lord has stolen all the light, so your mission is to enter his lair and defeat him. The dungeons layout is procedural so you won’t find items/enemies in the same place each time you play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my <a href="/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/">last post</a> I’ve detailed some of the new features and options so take a look for further detail.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I’ll leave you with a trailer featuring Xbox One gameplay footage, in case you haven’t see it.</p>
