      <description>I have great news.
Quest of Dungeons is coming to Nintendo 3DS on September 29.
A couple weeks ago I announced that QoD was being released for Wii U on September 29 but I didn’t had a specific release date for the Nintendo 3DS version.
I spent the last few weeks trying to sort all know issues on the Nintendo 3DS version and I’ve been working with Nintendo to see if it can be released at the same time as the Wii U version.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone!
You know that thing you’ve been asking me these past few weeks? I finally have a release day.
I’m very pleased to announce that Quest of Dungeons is coming to Xbox One on September 4th via the ID@Xbox self-publishing program.
After months of development I’m very excited to finally be able say that it will be available on your console on that day.
Quest of Dungeons is a turn based roguelike game, featuring that good old 16-bit art style we grew up with.</description>
