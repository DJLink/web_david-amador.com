      <description>Hey,
It’s been ages since my last post, feel like things keep getting in the way, also not much exciting stuff lately.
But decided to take a break from my current project to participate in Ludum Dare 42, it’s been years since the last time, also I liked the theme “Running out of Space” so I decided to hack something. To try and get out of my comfort zone I made my first game in Unity, so that was a fun experiment.</description>

<p>It’s been ages since my last post, feel like things keep getting in the way, also not much exciting stuff lately.</p>
<p>But decided to take a break from my current project to participate in Ludum Dare 42, it’s been years since the last time, also I liked the theme “Running out of Space” so I decided to hack something. To try and get out of my comfort zone I made my first game in Unity, so that was a fun experiment.</p>
<p>The game is a small top down shooting game, but when you miss an enemy you create a block instead, so the more you miss the less area to fly around. Here’s a gif illustrating.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Made code, art and sounds, cod is c# in Unity, art was made in photoshop, the sound effects I think you’ll notice right away how they were made, and finally used <a href="https://boscaceoil.net/">Bosca Ceoil</a> for music.</p>
<p>There’s a webGl version so you an try it directly in your browser.</p>

      <description>Some time ago I decided to launch a new website with a 48h Game Competition.
We are now 2 days away from the Compo#1. This is for every indie game developer wannabe =)
[Edit]
The first competition is now over. Check the results here

      <description>Dream Build Play submission deadline is over. Unfortunatly I didn’t had the time to put my prototype working. Maybe next year. I always had the impression I would finish it on time cause the main goal was always IGF.
Meanwhile I’ve been busy making the arrangements for The Indie Bay 48 hour game development competition.
The idea is for every entrant to make a game in 48 hours using a given theme or topic.</description>

<p>Meanwhile I’ve been busy making the arrangements for <a href="http://www.theindiebay.com">The Indie Bay</a> 48 hour <a href="http://www.theindiebay.com/competition">game development competition</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is for every entrant to make a game in 48 hours using a given theme or topic. Some cool prototypes may show up, games like Braid or World of Goo have been created in competitions like this one.</p>
<p>I’m also writing a couple of tutorials for <a href="http://www.theindiebay.com/category/articles/xna/building-a-2d-game-engine-in-xna/">building a 2d Game Engine in XNA</a>.</p>
