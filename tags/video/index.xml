      <description>Like some of you already know Iâ€™m currently out of job, the company where I worked like many out there closed due to, I donâ€™t know, financial issues, bad management, who knows. Even worse the news got out just before Christmas and it was not the holidays I intended to have. Times have been hard, since the last pay check I got was in November.
I worked there since 2006, almost 4 years, I joined the team back then in the hopes of joining something in the games industry.</description>

Even worse the news got out just before Christmas and it was not the holidays I intended to have. Times have been hard, since the last pay check I got was in November.</p>
<p>I worked there since 2006, almost 4 years, I joined the team back then in the hopes of joining something in the games industry. It was funny, built a couple of games, made part of big projects, learned much, learned that even more is to be learned. One year after I started making small prototype games on my free times as a joke and websites now and then for a couple of extra bucks.</p>
<p>Around August 2006 I approached <a href="http://www.twitter.com/_m0r3n4">Rita Silva</a> with an idea of building a small creative company. I knew her work, sheâ€™s very talented, check her <a href="http://www.rita-silva.com">blog</a> and a person like her creating all the looks and stuff for my projects would be a great help.</p>
<p>After a few weeks we came up with the name Different Pixel and registered in on October 10th. Made our first layout and we started selling hosting packages, we didnâ€™t get many clients but some of them are still with us and are pleased.</p>
<p>Due to our full-time job things were always kind of slow on Different Pixel evolution, we couldnâ€™t accept many jobs due to time restrictions.</p>
<p>Now and without jobs we decided to try and take this small project to higher grounds, we are no longer inexperienced and without background. We currently are working on two small games, but our main focus is still web development, since we have to pay bills =P</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not going to reveal much of the games now, this is just a small experience to see how the public reacts, if positive we can move to bigger projects.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sapphire1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sapphire1-300x193.jpg" alt=""  title="sapphire"  />
</a></p>
<p>Also Iâ€™ve been working like crazy on the past days on our internal xna map editor Sapphire. The idea is that you can use it with your own engine. Many features are done and much more are on the works.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a video showing an alpha version. Keep in mind that this is a work in progress.</p>

</div>

<p>Iâ€™ll be posting an update soon and possibly a beta to the public, the idea is to sell at a low price.</p>
<p>Stay tuned on our <a href="http://www.differentpixel.com">website</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/DifferentPixel">Twitter </a>or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DifferentPixel">Facebook </a>for updates, we promise lotâ€™s of news soon.</p>
<p>Wish us luck!!</p>

      <title>Basalt and Sapphire Updates</title>

      <description>Lately all my free time has been spent adding new features to Basalt and developing Sapphire.
Some months ago, I started building Sapphire, a 2D editor for helping me creating to create my maps. Unfortunately I made a bad choice and decided to integrate XNA with Windows Forms, although I managed to do it it was a real pain to add something simple and eventually I dropped it.
Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the previous alpha version:</description>

<p>Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the previous alpha version:</p>

</a></p>
<p>I kept working on the engine itself and just making small prototypes for testing it. Finally 2 weeks ago I decided to start from scratch and just use xna to build it. Not much is done but I have little time after work to develop. Anyway Iâ€™m happy since I already have textures import, basic object positioning, scaling and a Layer System.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sapphire.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sapphire-150x150.jpg" alt="sapphire"  title="sapphire"  />
</a></p>
<p>This is an early stage of the new editor, itâ€™s from last week.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D33185iWTQU" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>When I have some cool stuff Iâ€™ll update a new video.</p>
<p>On the engine side, today I decided to add a Console component to the engine, much like Source Engine and Quake consoles, to input commands, hereâ€™s the result:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Hopefully by the beginning of next year Iâ€™ll have a beta version that I can release to the public for testing. I intend to launch a free and a payed version of the engine+ editor. My only dout is if I trim down some functions or just release it as free for non-commercial usage only.</p>

      <title>Building an 2D Game Engine in XNA - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2009/10/building-an-2d-game-engine-in-xna-part-1/</link>

      <guid>https://www.david-amador.com/2009/10/building-an-2d-game-engine-in-xna-part-1/</guid>
      <description>I decided to starting writing a series of tutorials for building an 2d XNA game engine.
Keep in mind that while the main focus is 2d nothing prevents us from adding the 3d stuff later but for now we will stick to 2D.
Itâ€™s not very original but Iâ€™ll call this the Bay Engine. If anyone else has a better idea let me know.
Requirements:
You must have some Object Oriented Programming background to full understand what we will do here.</description>

      <title>XNA Camera 2d with zoom and rotation</title>

      <description>07/01/2011 â€“ By popular request updated to XNA 4.0, xna 3.1 code is still there too
One of the things I keep finding is people asking how to do a simple camera 2d in XNA. Today I decided to contribute with my own solution.
Most of the time the solution given is to have a class camera with a Vector2 position and when drawing the sprite batch to subtract the camera position to the sprite position itself.</description>

<p>One of the things I keep finding is people asking how to do a simple camera 2d in XNA. Today I decided to contribute with my own solution.</p>
<p>Most of the time the solution given is to have a class camera with a Vector2 position and when drawing the sprite batch to subtract the camera position to the sprite position itself. Although this work from my point of view itâ€™s not elegant and you canâ€™t have neat features like zooming and rotation. So for my tutorial Iâ€™ll do all transformations using a Matrix.<br>
Start off by creating the basic class Camera2d</p>

      <title>Basalt gains a media player</title>

      <description>So Iâ€™ve been working on a sort of media player in order to play movies on my 2d engine Basalt made on top of XNA.
By extending my class Object2d I manage to get this pretty cool result. You can even apply shaders to it. Since I extended the class from Object2d I can rotate, scale and set a position to the video besides regular options like play/pause, fullscreen etc. For those who donâ€™t know the video playing is a chunk of the series Naruto Shippuuden</description>

      <title>XNA Sprite Sheet</title>

      <description>I decided to take the morning to make a small sprite sheet editor for our Xna engine. This way the artist can easily define the sprite areas and their origin saving in a file that can later on be loaded on the engine.
Not very fancy yet but it gets the job done.
Next step will be making an animator editor.</description>

      <title>Pugna prototype</title>

      <description>Hello there.
Yes i know I havenâ€™t updated in awhile, Iâ€™ve been really busy. So the deadline for Dream Build Play is 5 days from now and up till yesterday I havenâ€™t made anything.
My goal was to have a prototype by now to submit to DBP, but I ainâ€™t got anything. So today I decided to see what I could do from scratch, and not related to the main idea that Rita and I have for the game we should have submitted.</description>

<p>Yes i know I havenâ€™t updated in awhile, Iâ€™ve been really busy. So the deadline for Dream Build Play is 5 days from now and up till yesterday I havenâ€™t made anything.</p>
<p>My goal was to have a prototype by now to submit to DBP, but I ainâ€™t got anything. So today I decided to see what I could do from scratch, and not related to the main idea that <a href="http://www.rita-silva.com">Rita</a> and I have for the game we should have submitted.</p>
<p>One of my favorites games was Zelda The Fours Sword Adventures, the hole 4 players playing on one screen is cool. I picked the name Pugna, means fight. So the game allows up to 4 players on split screen.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Screenshot002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Screenshot002-300x168.jpg" alt="Screenshot002"  title="Screenshot002"  />
</a></p>
<p>Iâ€™ve quite proud of having made this in around 4-5 hours. Till now I have a scalable level that renders grass. Screen division is made automatically according to number of players. As you can see on the following image it has a 2 split.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Screenshot001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Screenshot001-300x168.jpg" alt="Screenshot001"  title="Screenshot001"  />
</a></p>
<p>I have basic movement and rotation and a title screen. I wonâ€™t be having a great game but I have a couple of nice ideas that can work out with time.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a small video, the framerate is due to the sofware i use to record.</p>

      <description>I recently found that there is a subversion alternative surfacing that is in many ways much better that subversion, it name is Git and itâ€™s a creation of Linus Torvalds.
Hereâ€™s a video of him talking about it</description>
