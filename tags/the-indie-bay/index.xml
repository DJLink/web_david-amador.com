      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dream Build Play submission deadline is over. Unfortunatly I didn’t had the time to put my prototype working. Maybe next year. I always had the impression I would finish it on time cause the main goal was always IGF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I’ve been busy making the arrangements for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theindiebay.com&#34;&gt;The Indie Bay&lt;/a&gt; 48 hour &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theindiebay.com/competition&#34;&gt;game development competition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is for every entrant to make a game in 48 hours using a given theme or topic. Some cool prototypes may show up, games like Braid or World of Goo have been created in competitions like this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
