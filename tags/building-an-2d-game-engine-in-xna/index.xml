      <description>I decided to starting writing a series of tutorials for building an 2d XNA game engine.
Keep in mind that while the main focus is 2d nothing prevents us from adding the 3d stuff later but for now we will stick to 2D.
It’s not very original but I’ll call this the Bay Engine. If anyone else has a better idea let me know.
Requirements:
You must have some Object Oriented Programming background to full understand what we will do here.</description>
