      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/twinturbo_02l.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;twinturbo_02l&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/twinturbo_02l-150x150.jpg&#34; title=&#34;twinturbo_02l&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Because my Ati Radeon 4890 fan fried I had to buy another cooler. After a little research I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20101017105319/http://www.arctic-cooling.com:80/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=2_&amp;amp;mID=101&amp;amp;language=en&#34;&gt;Artic Accelero Twin Turbo&lt;/a&gt;. Today I decided to finally try it. The assembly is rather easy, the package comes with several heatsinks for memories, and of course the fans themselves. There are three ways to connect the fans, either directly to the VGA card itself, directly to the PSU with 7V or 12V.&lt;br&gt;
My stock cooler was connected to the vga card so I left it the same. Bad choice, with the card idle I was getting around 70Âº, way hot. I switched the fans to the PSU with 12V and voila, the Artic promissed values, around 50Âº, a decrease of around 20Âº, which is great. As for the noise I can barely hear it. So if you buy one connect it to the board.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Graphic Card and psu</title>
      <link>https://www.david-amador.com/2009/06/new-graphic-card-and-psu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to buy another a new graphic card. I got tired of my old Geforce 8500 GT sloweness. It was slow on 3dsmax, it was slow on recent games and most of all I have this thing for Ati so this was never my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research I decided to get a XFX Ati Radeon 4890, most of the reviews were positive and its placed in a mid-range pricing. The first thing I was dissapointed was that my old Eurotech PSU would not be enough since my 12v rail had only 16A so I also bought a Corsair TX 650W.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>After some research I decided to get a XFX Ati Radeon 4890, most of the reviews were positive and its placed in a mid-range pricing. The first thing I was dissapointed was that my old Eurotech PSU would not be enough since my 12v rail had only 16A so I also bought a Corsair TX 650W.</p>
<p>After installing all I booted up the pc to find that the new psu was more silent that my old one but the xfx is louder, which is no surprise.</p>
<p>I was able to run Crysis at 1920Ã—1080 on very high with no antialiasing at a stable 30fps, so with a little tweaking i should be able to get a much higher framerate. Left 4 Dead at same resolution everything maxed up runs between 50-60 fps ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>Iâ€™m very happy with it. 3dsmax 2010 also runs faster and i notice the diference particularly on skining and mapping.</p>
