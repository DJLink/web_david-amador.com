      <description>Because my Ati Radeon 4890 fan fried I had to buy another cooler. After a little research I discovered Artic Accelero Twin Turbo. Today I decided to finally try it. The assembly is rather easy, the package comes with several heatsinks for memories, and of course the fans themselves. There are three ways to connect the fans, either directly to the VGA card itself, directly to the PSU with 7V or 12V.</description>

      <description>I decided to buy another a new graphic card. I got tired of my old Geforce 8500 GT sloweness. It was slow on 3dsmax, it was slow on recent games and most of all I have this thing for Ati so this was never my favorite.
After some research I decided to get a XFX Ati Radeon 4890, most of the reviews were positive and its placed in a mid-range pricing.</description>
