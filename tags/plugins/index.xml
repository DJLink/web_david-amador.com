      <description>During my efforts to combine Rita’s website to wordpress and with a cool gallery I came up with a few problems.
Mainly because the top navigation bar was built using J-Query, which I’ve already made quite some time ago, and even after switching to mootools I didn’t want to be rebuilding it again.
So yesterday after a few searches I managed to install NextGen gallery plugin for wordpress and using LightBox for popups.</description>

<p>So yesterday after a few searches I managed to install <a href="http://alexrabe.boelinger.com/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGen</a> gallery plugin for wordpress and using LightBox for popups. It even has a watermark option. I recommend anyone having a gallery on their website to give it a try. It’s really cool and free for use.</p>
