&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Iâ€™m not deadâ€¦.yetâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s just that Iâ€™ve been stuck on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.differentpixel.com&#34;&gt;Different Pixel&lt;/a&gt; development dungeon for the past weeks finishing and polishing (bug hunting) my first game, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150105005354/http://www.differentpixel.com/games/vizati/&#34;&gt;Vizati&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you have been following the process and asking things every since we showed the beta version at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.david-amador.com/2010/03/vizati-wins-xna-pizza-night-2010/&#34;&gt;XNA Pizza Night&lt;/a&gt;, after which we decided to finish the game and try to sell it to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months later and here I am, making the final touches on the game before itâ€™s release on 11th June. The game will be available thought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-VIZ/vizati&#34;&gt;GamersGate&lt;/a&gt; (maybe others, Iâ€™ll update in the future).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Itâ€™s just that Iâ€™ve been stuck on <a href="http://www.differentpixel.com">Different Pixel</a> development dungeon for the past weeks finishing and polishing (bug hunting) my first game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105005354/http://www.differentpixel.com/games/vizati/">Vizati</a>.</p>
<p>Most of you have been following the process and asking things every since we showed the beta version at <a href="/2010/03/vizati-wins-xna-pizza-night-2010/">XNA Pizza Night</a>, after which we decided to finish the game and try to sell it to see how it goes.</p>
<p>Three months later and here I am, making the final touches on the game before itâ€™s release on 11th June. The game will be available thought <a href="http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-VIZ/vizati">GamersGate</a> (maybe others, Iâ€™ll update in the future).</p>
<p>It has always been a personal dream of mine to be a game developer so Iâ€™m crossing fingers to see if this works and most of all so that people like the game, we want them to have fun with it.</p>
<p>The game was made from scratch by me and Rita (one programmer and one designer) with a $0 budget (just the enough to eat ðŸ˜› ) in XNA. We used it because the competition we went required it and since it has been a stable framework we decided to stick with it even on PC. We even have a <a href="/2010/05/vizati-in-windows-phone-7/">Windows Phone 7 </a>working version.</p>
<p>So in the next few days (as soon as the Gold Master is released) Iâ€™ll be shouting and annoying everyone to buy the game.</p>
