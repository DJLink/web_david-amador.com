      <description>No, I’m not dead….yet…
It’s just that I’ve been stuck on Different Pixel development dungeon for the past weeks finishing and polishing (bug hunting) my first game, Vizati.
Most of you have been following the process and asking things every since we showed the beta version at XNA Pizza Night, after which we decided to finish the game and try to sell it to see how it goes.
Three months later and here I am, making the final touches on the game before it’s release on 11th June.</description>
