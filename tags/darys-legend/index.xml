      <description>Almost 4 months without a post, this is the first time it happened.
It was nothing in particular that held me back, I just kept postponing and, to be honest, I only write posts when I have something I really want to write about.
Before going into the rest of the post, I would like to ask people to update my feed url on your RSS readers. I always used Feedburner to redirect feeds, and with Google Reader going down I decided to start switching, so in your new FeedsReader use this address: (&amp;lt;/feed/&amp;gt;).</description>

      <title>Dary&#39;s Legend alpha released</title>

      <description>Yay, so a milestone was reached with this project. If you follow my blog you probably already know that between small projects like Puwang and other mandatory freelancing stuff my big project in hands for these past few months is Dary’s Legend, a roguelike.
Around two months ago I coincidentally bumped into a conversation about funding and the whole kickstarter thing where one of Desura staff members was participating, and while talking about my own problems funding a whole game out of my pocket he mentioned that he knew the game and that Desura’s Alpha Funding might be a good place for it.</description>

      <description>Working on Dary’s Legend has been my daily routine so I decided to make a time lapse.
So this is a video compiled using Chronolapse, by taking a screenshot every 60s during a couple of days while I’m working on Dary’s Legend, the new game from Different Pixel. The video is being played back at 10 real minutes per second.
This was recorded between 14-06-2012 and 30-06-2012 (some days are missing)</description>

      <description>So, yeah I know I’ve been a little lazy about my blog it’s for a good cause.
We decided to release a small teaser showing what we have. I can’t stress this enough, it’s a work in progress.
I can’t find out how to embed the video with HD by default so don’t forget to see in 720p
Lately I’ve been working mostly on small UI stuff, pixel tuning every menu/button and graphical interfaces in the game.</description>

      <description>We finally released some screenshots of Dary’s Legend.
Lately I’ve been working on the light system and fog of war for the game, it’s visible on the images.
Here’s the official post but I’ve placed the images here for convenience.</description>

      <description>New game, called Dary’s Legend, a roguelike, dungeon crawling type.
This is what I’ve been working on lately, and … well not much more to say.
I’ll try and do posts with relevant stuff regarding the development of the game from now on.
Going back to coding now…</description>
