      <description>I decided to make a game for the xna7day competition, in which we have to make a game that only uses 2 keys, so absolutely no analog input and it has to be built on xna of course.
This is a great opportunity to test my engine Basalt.
I decided to make a puzzle game, basically the rules are the same of a 3 in line game.
This is what I have so far.</description>
