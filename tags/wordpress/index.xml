      <description>Yesterday, I shutdown the VPS that has been hosting all my websites for the last ~10 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved everything to static content, including this website.
üìù WordPress Since the very beginning (~2008) this blog has been powered by WordPress, it served me well, it worked, had a nice backend to make the posts, plugins and themes. After a couple years I moved from shared hosting to a VPS, I had other websites and services I needed running and all in same machine was better and cheaper.</description>

      <title>Search and Replace in MySQL</title>

      <description>I found something very handy today, search and replace on Mysql databases. You can do it on phpmyadmin or make a php script with this.
After moving a wordpress site from server I discovered that all image links were broken because they are placed directly inside each post. They were still linking to the old server. Changing it manually would be a nightmare.
Luckily MySql is your friend. To search and replace a text string, start up phpMyAdmin, and click on your database name that you want to run the search and replace through.</description>

      <title>WordPress Gallery</title>

      <description>During my efforts to combine Rita‚Äôs website to wordpress and with a cool gallery I came up with a few problems.
Mainly because the top navigation bar was built using J-Query, which I‚Äôve already made quite some time ago, and even after switching to mootools I didn‚Äôt want to be rebuilding it again.
So yesterday after a few searches I managed to install NextGen gallery plugin for wordpress and using LightBox for popups.</description>
