You just press a key and voil√°!\nSome of the new features New mansion and custom mode\nAfter you finish Omphar you will have access to another new mansion called Rackan, and a custom game mode, where you can choose amount of floors (within a certain range), dungeon size and difficulty. Also in custom the floors themes are mixed in so you usually get a different ‚Äúflavor‚Äù each time.\nNew class\nAlso after finishing the game you have access to the Necrodancer, which is a bonus character that mixes in several of the other classes, It‚Äôs very cool to play with especially if you played the original game.\nGhost Hero Another cool thing is that you can now find yourself in ghost from a previous run.

However, if you connect your Xbox One to a monitor and play close, you can set to 1x (which I personally think it‚Äôs better for viewing up close). You can also scale the game itself to 2x if you prefer, again it‚Äôs a matter of personal preference, depending on your setup.\nScreen area Since the Xbox version will be mostly to run on Television screens there are a couple of specific options, like a screen area, because some television cut a percentage of the screen, you have an option to put the UI on a smaller area.\nKey Binding\nThere is a settings screen for rebinding some of the game controller buttons.\nLanguage It‚Äôs possible to choose different languages (other than English)\nOh and last but not least, here‚Äôs the game cover for Xbox One üôÇ\nAlso I want to show you what I‚Äôve done to my own controller.\nAwesome right?\nAnd that‚Äôs it for now, there are several other tweaks and improvements, but I won‚Äôt get into detail. I hope this helps getting a better view of everything that I tried to bring to the XO version, to make it feel ‚Äúat home‚Äù.\nI‚Äôll have more news soon.\n","wordCount":"530","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2015-07-14T14:49:55Z","dateModified":"2015-07-14T14:49:55Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Amador"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.david-amador.com/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"David Amador","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.david-amador.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.david-amador.com accesskey=h title="David Amador (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.david-amador.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>David Amador</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.david-amador.com/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.david-amador.com/games/ title=Games><span>Games</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.david-amador.com/portfolio/ title=Portfolio><span>Portfolio</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.david-amador.com/about/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.david-amador.com/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.david-amador.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.david-amador.com>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://www.david-amador.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Let's talk about the new stuff in Quest of Dungeons for Xbox One</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2015-07-14 14:49:55 +0000 UTC'>July 14, 2015</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;530 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;David Amador&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/2015-07-14-lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I‚Äôve been talking about some of the new stuff here and then, but it‚Äôs time to show the Xbox version in more detail.
