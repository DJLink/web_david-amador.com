This wouldn’t be possible without everyone who supported me, in one way or another, so even if I do work a lot to make the best possible I can, if no one cared, it wouldn’t be possible, so thank you.\nIndie life\nI took the jump to full time indie developer this year again, back in March, it wasn’t something I was planning, but was semi forced to do because of some internal restructuring the company was having, so I left. With the Xbox One port of Quest of Dungeons in hands, and falling behind on my personal deadlines, I decided to risk take a couple months and finish it. One one hand I have more freedom, and can work on games, on the other hand there’s the constant fear of “this is the last month” if everything fails and games stop selling. I also decided to start taking care of myself health-wise, by exercising more regularly, and for the most part of the year I did almost everyday a 6-8 KM fast-paced walk right after waking up, overall I fell much better, which helps with the mood and work altogether. The weird thing is that I had to get a gadget in order to feel more motivated, got a fitbit that tracks daily activity, been wearing it for 10 months now, so gamificating health ftw. Personal note, take some proper vacations next year, and by proper I mean, in any place, but disconnected from emails/work and whatever.\nQoD on Xbox One\nWhen I left in March, I was already way behind on my original launch plans, because developing for a console is a whole different thing and doing it during nights only was quickly draining my energies.\nThe following months were mainly devoted to finishing the game, I had to redo a lot of the UI and gameplay to accommodate a game controller and other stuff, but eventually on September 4 I finally released it and I was genuinely surprised by the overwhelming positive feedback, since, at that point the game was out for some time in its PC and Mobile form, but the new additions/changes and the fact that you could play it with a controller for the first time made it more appealing for many people.\nLooking back, it took me a full year, from getting the game approved to the actual release. While it’s a lot of time, I also think it was worth it, a lot of the game was tweaked, also for some part I still had my day job, certifications take some time also. In fact the final build was finished around June, I just took those “extra” months to finding bugs/polishing and start to approach journalists/websites.\nGDC/Gamescom\nOne of the things I’ve always wanted to attend, at least once, was GDC (Game Developers Conference), and this year I was finally able to, to the European one, which despite being expensive, is still less expensive then traveling to the US. And of course since it’s on the same week, I also went to Gamescom, and it was amazing, it’s much bigger then EGX, I had no idea. During GDC I was able to meet tons of cool developers, attend some parties (which is usually not my thing) and learn a lot overall.\nI was also able to watch a Video Games Live concert for the first time, and I loved it, even got a photo with Tommy Tallarico.\nNow \u0026 Future(?)\nWith the release of the XO version, a lot of people are asking what am I doing right now, “Are you on vacation?”, “New game?”. I can definitely say that I’m not on vacation mode right now, I’m already working on something for next year, which is kind of a semi-secret right now, mostly because I’m still unsure if I can pull it off. I started working on a concept for a new game, but something unexpected came up and it’s possible that Quest of Dungeons will get a new port, but now is not the time to talk about it, because at this point is not 100% sure it will, but that’s what I’m working on now.\nOn a final note, another thing that comes to mind is that I’ve been blogging way less, I used to post a lot more stuff, especially tutorials of some kind, and I haven’t, so one of the things I wanna change is to write at least one post a month next year. It happened very little this year because I’ve been mostly working with NDA stuff and it’s hard to “Here’s how I fixed this”.\nHappy New year!\n",

<p><strong>GDC/Gamescom</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I’ve always wanted to attend, at least once, was GDC (Game Developers Conference), and this year I was finally able to, to the European one, which despite being expensive, is still less expensive then traveling to the US.

I can definitely say that I’m not on vacation mode right now, I’m already working on something for next year, which is kind of a semi-secret right now, mostly because I’m still unsure if I can pull it off. I started working on a concept for a new game, but something unexpected came up and it’s possible that Quest of Dungeons will get a new port, but now is not the time to talk about it, because at this point is not 100% sure it will, but that’s what I’m working on now.</p>

Fox (as Marty McFly)"  />

<p>On a final note, another thing that comes to mind is that I’ve been blogging way less, I used to post a lot more stuff, especially tutorials of some kind, and I haven’t, so one of the things I wanna change is to write at least one post a month next year. It happened very little this year because I’ve been mostly working with NDA stuff and it’s hard to “Here’s how I fixed this”.</p>
<p>Happy New year!</p>
