  <div class="post-content"><p>Hey, it‚Äôs been a while.</p>
<p>For the past few months I‚Äôve been working on porting Quest of Dungeons to Xbox One, and I‚Äôm super happy that it‚Äôs finally out. It was released around a week ago, on <a href="/2015/09/quest-of-dungeons-is-now-available-on-xbox-one/">September 4</a>.</p>
<p>This took some time but I‚Äôm happy of the way the game is played with a gamepad, after a lot of changes to the UI I really feel like it was worth all the effort I put into it. If you wanna read more about the new stuff on the XO version you can find the article <a href="/2015/07/lets-talk-about-the-new-stuff-in-quest-of-dungeons-for-xbox-one/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The players feedback and reviews were very positive as well. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>I also want to thank everyone who emailed and tweeted me, watching everyone having fun with the game warms the hearth üôÇ</p>
<p><strong>So what is next?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been getting that question a lot. ‚ÄúAre you making more games?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you working on something new already?‚Äù<br>
QoD has kept me pretty busy until now, so while I have some ideas in my mind I haven‚Äôt really started anything new, my ideas may very well not be even good at all, I need to test and prototype to see what I wanna do next. I still need to do a patch to QoD to fix some stuff, that is the priority now, but that should only keep me busy until the end of the month. After that it‚Äôs time to jump into something new, which is kind of scary, but exciting at the same time. I have no idea if I can ever make a game that people will like, like they did with QoD, but I‚Äôll do my best.</p>
