New project
I’ve been talking about this via twitter for the past few weeks but this is the first official post talking about it. In last 7 Days Rogue-like I had this desire to make another one, a faster, less feature oriented RL, just explore and kill. I didn’t made much of the prototype at that time, but in the past month I returned to it, worked a bit more intensively and decided to launch it to iOS. The game is nearly finished and I’m just tweaking difficulty and other bugs.">

  <div class="post-content"><p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So a lot of things have happened since my last post.</p>
<p><strong>New project</strong><br>
I’ve been talking about this via twitter for the past few weeks but this is the first official post talking about it. In last 7 Days Rogue-like I had this desire to make another one, a faster, less feature oriented RL, just explore and kill. I didn’t made much of the prototype at that time, but in the past month I returned to it, worked a bit more intensively and decided to launch it to iOS. The game is nearly finished and I’m just tweaking difficulty and other bugs.</p>

<p>I’m in the final stages of development, so if everything goes as planned I’m releasing it in ~ 2 months.</p>
<p><strong>New job</strong></p>
<p>About a month ago I was approached by a company (Sapo) for a possible job position. After a series of interviews I was offered the job and I accepted it. As most of you know I’ve been working in gamedev for most of my professional career. This new job position is not related to game development, but it’s an excellent opportunity in what I consider a good company. One of the things that got me to accept is the fact that I’m being thrown out of my comfort zone, which is something that is going to make me have to learn and dig into new technologies, and that is always valuable for a programmer. The fact that I’ll be working with a bigger team is also good, in past jobs teams were smaller and in my gamedev works it’s usually 1-2 people.<br>
They were very cool about letting me do my indie game development on my free time, which is something great, because I intend to keep doing it. I’ve been doing it for the past 3 years and I intend to keep it that way.</p>
<p>As part of this I had to move to a new town (Lisbon), I lived nearby a couple years ago so it’s not totally unknown to me.<br>
I’ll update once I know more info about the release date for Quest of Dungeon.<br>
And you know you can always poke me via twitter, where I do my daily rants.</p>
