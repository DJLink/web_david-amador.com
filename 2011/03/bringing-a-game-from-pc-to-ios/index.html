Even though I only have one product on the App Store I have gathered some knowledge on how stuff works to get there.</p>
<p>I’ll start by talking a bit about how we made our PC game <a href="http://vizati.differentpixel.com/">Vizati</a> to iPhone.<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/vizati/id393099810?mt=8"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/box_vizati_11-208x300.jpg" alt=""  title="box_vizati_1"  />
</a></p>
<p>When we started, this represented our chance of making games and putting ourselves into test. Without any pre determined rules and/or a major company dictating what to do we were able to have full creative control to try and do something a bit different.</p>
<p><em>Vizati</em> is a casual puzzle game with a story as a background. The game is now available for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad and Windows Phone 7. Developed by only two people, it thankfully received several good reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Launching for Windows</strong></p>
<p>We started out building for Windows and Xbox360 because it was a very well known platform for us; we had tools and knowledge from other games so it felt right.</p>
<p>We launched the game on June 6<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and got some very positive reviews, being its freshness, graphics and music the most acclaimed features.</p>
<p>Right away we started making plans for bringing the game to iOS devices, iPhone, iPad etc. The mobile devices felt like a great platform for such a game.</p>
<p><strong>First speed bump</strong></p>
<p>For the PC we had built the game engine using XNA framework as a base, it is DirectX based but it uses .Net languages which are a no go for iOS devices of course. It was stable enough to ensure a high compatibility with all the different machines out there, and we never thought at start to make it for any other platforms. This was our first mistake.</p>
<p>For the next 3 months I had to rewrite all the game codebase to C++ including building the engine itself using render API OpenGLES. <a href="/2010/07/developing-on-mac-and-basalt-running-on-the-iphone/" title="Developing on Mac and Basalt running on the iPhone">[Dedicated Post]</a></p>
<p>During these 3 months we also had to adjust the game to the iPhone screen size. Just out of curiosity the native resolution on PC is HD, 1280×720 and the iPhone native is 640×426. <a href="/2010/09/targetting-ios-devices-hardware/" title="Targetting iOS devices hardware">[See more on iOS hardware]</a></p>
<p>At first we considered using the same images and using the same feature we used on PC to <a href="/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/" title="XNA 2D Independent Resolution Rendering">automatically scale the game</a> to the screen size. But doing that would be a tremendous effort to the device since the iPhone screen size was almost 3 times smaller; memory and CPU cycles are more limited in mobiles so we had to make a smarter approach.</p>
<p>One of the problems was the game being extremely slow on older devices. The amount of particles and animations on some parts was a total killer. I eventually had to <a href="/2010/08/developers-log-stardate-26082010/" title="Developers log stardate 26082010">rewrite my primitive drawing code </a>to batch stuff as much as possible</p>
<p>Another problem was the aspect ratio, which would lead to either stretching the game vertically thus distorting the images or making it letterboxed.</p>
