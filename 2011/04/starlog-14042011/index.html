I started working on it on December 2009. It’s not a day to night work. This also allowed me to have much more control on porting.\nQ: Will you release the source code?\nA: At the moment there’s no plans to release it either in open source, paid or binary mode. Why? Because I don’t think it’s ready for any of them. There’s tons of hacked lines, tons of //todo, stuff I haven’t tested, others I know that don’t work but haven’t got the time, etc etc.\nWhile I’ve considered to sell/release it I don’t think it’s ready and honestly at this point there are far better solutions out there.\nQ: Can I get access to the source to help you improving the engine?\nA: Sorry, no, see previous answer.\nQ: Is it genre oriented like Source is oriented for FPS?\nA: Not a chance, at this point I can pretty much do anything I want, at least in 2D.
