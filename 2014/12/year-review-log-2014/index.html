 WOW, 2014 is already coming to an end. Can’t even believe the amount of things that happened to me this year, some bad, some good, I decided to make a wall of text.</p>
<p>This was been a great year for my game dev objectives. In January I got <a href="/2014/02/quest-of-dungeons-approved-on-steam/" title="Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam">Quest of Dungeons approved on Steam</a> in only 6 days, which was mind blowing, on March 25th I finally got it released, and during the rest of the year several other platforms got a port, like Linux and <a href="/2014/08/native-game-on-android-porting-quest-of-dungeons/" title="Native game on Android – Porting Quest of Dungeons">Android</a>, both platforms that I never had worked before, so I learned a lot. Finally on October I got QoD <a href="http://www.upfallstudios.com/blog/2014/10/quest-of-dungeons-is-coming-to-xbox-one/">approved for Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be at <a href="/2014/10/egx-2014/" title="EGX 2014">EGX 2014 in London</a>, I loved it, this was my first time on such an event and I was amazed by everything, even more because I got to meet so many cool people, and other developers who I’ve been following their work for years.</p>
<p>Also I created a new brand for my indie games, called <a href="http://www.upfallstudios.com">Upfall Studios</a>, in order to give it a more professional look.</p>
<p>Not everything is good and this year I got a glimpse of what happens when you push yourself for years, I’ve been making games for quite some time now, switching between working on them full time or splitting with a day job (gotta pay rent), around February I collapsed, ended up in the hospital and had to take a 2 week sick leave, it was not pretty. So resolution for next year, taking care of myself better, work less but more efficiently.</p>
<p>It was kind of a weird year in gaming for me, I skipped the Wii completely (last generation was the Xbox 360) but for this generation I got the WiiU, which I love btw, and I started having that nostalgia feeling and playing older games, in fact I spent Christmas playing Super Mario World and Mario RPG on my SNES.</p>
<p><em>Some of the coolest games</em>:</p>
<p>Shovel Knight<br>
Crypt of the Necrodancer<br>
Nuclear Throne<br>
Mario Kart 8<br>
The Last of Us Remastered<br>
Bayonetta<br>
Super Mario 3D World<br>
Alien Isolation</p>
<p><em>Movies</em>:<br>
Guardians on the Galaxy<br>
OMG GO SEE INTERSTELLAR RIGHT NOW!!</p>
<p><em>TV Shows</em>:<br>
True Detective</p>
<p><em>(there are several other, this is just a very small curated list)</em></p>
<p>I have to idea what 2015 holds but I’m looking forward to it, the plans so far are to finish the Xbox One port and start working on the next project.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>
