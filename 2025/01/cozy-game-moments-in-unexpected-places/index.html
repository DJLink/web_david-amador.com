Those are great, and it’s incredible to see the indie scene doing many interesting things in that department.\nBut I always have this on the back on my mind as one of my favourite things, one thing I’m usually very interested in, cozy feelings/atmosphere that can be found in unexpected places.\nThey can come in a variety of genres or situations, even if the overall game is not about that. What fascinates me about this is my own taste for “comfort movies”, when you ask someone what their comfort movie is, it’s a wide range of action, horror, comedy, drama, sci-fi and more, it’s not always obvious.\nSo in this post, I just to dump a bit of my thoughts on some of the games that I found interesting.\nLet’s start by an obvious to understand, and possibly one of my all time favourite ones …\nSanctuaries of survival Resident Evil - Ok read it again but with the title voice, RESIDENT EVIL. Thanks :)\nRE games, for those who never played, might seem like a weird pick for “cozy”, and it is, but let’s focus on the first few games here, they are pure suspense and horror games, gore, scares, you die a lot, however, they pull off one of the most relaxing game rooms maps ever made, the Save Rooms. That’s why I was mentioning the originals mostly, from Zero, 1, 2 and 3 the save rooms are so damn good.\nThese locations as the name implies is where the player can save, but also, they allow you to breathe a little, small pockets of safety, where there are no dangers, you are locked from the monsters and you can manage your inventory.\nOn top of that, soothing music plays in the background, seriously, it’s near perfect. The feeling is so strong, that the first few times, after you reach them, you don’t want to leave, you are immediately attached to them. You can control when you leave, and leave you will, but at your pace, eagerly waiting for the next one. Unless you’re out of Ink Ribbons!\nHere, I’ll save you the trouble of searching the RE Save Room music :)\nA Home Away From Home Final Fantasy VII, despite its epic scale and combats, dozens of hours of gameplay and storyline, joy and sadness, offers moments of quiet coziness during the difficult journey around the world.\nWhenever we are exploring a town, entering other people’s houses (classic RPG!), everything has an inviting atmosphere. These spaces, though simple, feel familiar and offer a sense of relaxation.\nIt’s the small details, like a carefully placed painting or a comfy-looking bed, that contributes to this feeling of comfort. These moments actually do a lot for the game’s personality, especially because a lot of long dialogues take place in these environments, so you don’t feel out of place, or with the urge to leave right away. Maybe it’s it’s painted nature, maybe it’s the camera angle, but the Remake couldn’t replicate this feeling.\nJourneys into the Unknown I only recently played Syberia, all because of Nintendo Switch, I saw the game and felt like it was a good fit. The game has a somewhat slow pace which helps with giving us change to visually absorb the world. I couldn’t quite put my finger in it but I was immediately drawn to it, the game can be defined mostly by it’s sense of of melancholic beauty and isolation at first. The mechanical town, some of the most eerie scenarios. And yet, the total feeling of comfort really comes after we get to use the train.\nBy becoming Kate Walker primary mode of transport, after many many puzzles, it soon turns not only into a transport but also a home, becoming surprisingly cozy, and the only way to move forward. The rhythmic melody of the engine, the passing landscapes, and the quiet solitude of the train compartment create a sense of journey and reflection. These moments allow Kate and the player to process the events, adding warmth to the game’s overall atmosphere.\nA Different Kind of Cozy I’m a big fan of Little Nightmares (I and II), to me very special games, it ranges from cute to horrific, majority of it’s vibes are Ghibli-meets-Nightmare-Before-Christmas aesthetic esque scenarios, giving it a cartoony look that looks secure but it just happens to take place at “Silent Hill levels of horror”.\nThere are elements of coziness, just not in the traditional kind, not even the one that I might say there will be moments where you’ll feel relaxed. You’re never quite there, but feels like it could.\nInstead, it’s tied to the feeling of being small and vulnerable in a large and dangerous world, it’s an odd one, the feeling of crawling through vents, hiding under furniture, and finding small pockets of safety create a sense of childlike vulnerability, which can be surprisingly comforting in its own way.\nIt’s a dangerous world that wants to kill you, but empty it has it’s charm and calmness.\nOk thanks for sticking around, I hope you enjoyed, let me know other games you felt they had cozy moments, atmosphere or other in unexpected places.\nSee you in the next post!\n",

<p>It&rsquo;s the small details, like a carefully placed painting or a comfy-looking bed, that contributes to this feeling of comfort.

Maybe it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s painted nature, maybe it&rsquo;s the camera angle, but the Remake couldn&rsquo;t replicate this feeling.</p>
