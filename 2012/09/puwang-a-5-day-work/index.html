  <div class="post-content"><p>Hi, how’s everyone doing?</p>
<p>So this was a different week for me. It’s been a long time that I had the chance to work on a small prototype or a 48H competition because of my work on Dary’s Legend so I decided to stop for a couple of days and do something else.</p>
<p>Also my cat’s been quite sick, and between the Vet and taking care of him, working on a fun project gave me more time do everything.</p>
<p>Since I love shump games I decided to do one. The idea is simple, you are in a arena with your ship and you just blast enemies away.</p>
<p>Initially I worked around 6-8hours on this back in August but had to drop it because of some much other work I had, so it wasn’t until this monday I grabbed it again.</p>
<p>I decided to make the game for iOS because it’s easier to make prototypes there and I can carry them around everywhere, playing them, to see if they are any good.</p>
<p>Actually the first 8 hours where quite productive and this is what I had after that time:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sfxpNnfoZQI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>So during these past 5 days I polished it a little, grabbed myself a notepad and hand-drawn everything. It’s not much artistic, but I’m not a designer.<br>
Had a few problems with iOS 6 due to some deprecated stuff but in the end it all fall into place.<br>
Also some tweaks performance-wise on the Engine where made since with a lot of stuff on screen things can get out of control pretty easily specially on these portable devices.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 just came out and I even took the time to add support for those extra pixels, actually I just increased the viewport, no scaling.</p>
<p>I probably named it poorly but it’s <strong>Puwang</strong>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Also added some Leaderboards via Gamecenter and as I write this I’m starting to receive some feedback of the early beta builds I sent to a couple of testers. If people like it I might release it on the App Store.</p>
